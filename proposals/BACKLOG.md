# BACKLOG — Vugg Simulator

Living list of open work items, captured from session conversations so context survives compaction. Each item has enough detail that someone picking it up cold can act without re-discovering the rationale.

> ## 🔮 STANDING GOAL (2026-06-22) — realistic crystal TRANSPARENCY & COLOUR (render layer)
>
> Boss directive. A whole-render-layer realism goal, NOT a one-scenario job. Today optical
> properties are ad-hoc: habits paint a flat `class_color` on an opaque material and
> transparency is hand-set per tenant (selenite blade `opacity 0.82` inline; Naica's giant
> crystals should read water-CLEAR but don't). Make a crystal LOOK like what it physically is:
> - **Diaphaneity** as a real per-mineral field: transparent (quartz/fluorite/gypsum/calcite)
>   → translucent → opaque (galena/pyrite/magnetite). Drive material transparent/opacity/
>   transmission from data, not inline constants.
> - **Lustre**: vitreous / adamantine (cerussite, anglesite) / metallic (sulfides) / pearly
>   (apophyllite basal) / greasy (sphalerite) → roughness/metalness/specular.
> - **Body-colour fidelity**: make the rendered hue/saturation/depth match the real specimen,
>   and sit colour correctly WITH transparency (transparent amethyst = purple AND see-through).
>   Compose with the existing trace-cation colour dispatchers (V⁴⁺ apophyllite, smoky quartz,
>   Cr/Mn/Fe garnet, Y-fluorite).
> - **Optional**: colour visible THROUGH a transparent crystal (phantoms, sceptre boundary,
>   internal sector zoning legibility).
>
> Likely shape: a per-mineral `optics` block in minerals.json (diaphaneity + lustre + colour
> notes) feeding ONE material-builder in js/99i, replacing scattered inline constants. Can be
> SIM-NEUTRAL where it reads existing data — keep it so. **Wants its own research pass +
> design doc (`proposals/RESEARCH-optical-realism-*.md`) before code** — colour & clarity are
> exactly what a real specimen falsifies fastest ([[feedback_terminal_verification_specimens]],
> defer-to-geology, image-corpus method). Full goal text in
> `proposals/HANDOFF-APOPHYLLITE-AND-GYPSUM-2026-06-22.md` (➕ NEW GOAL section).

> ## ⬡ ARC (2026-06-22) — DIRECTIONAL / POLAR / STEPPED GROWTH (the central-distance model) — RESEARCHED · PHASE 0+1+3 SHIPPED (byte-identical, render-only)
>
> Boss directive: "geologically accurate wireframe models … asymmetric stepped growth — steps
> on one face-set not all, opposite faces smoother; polarized growth, one end faster, the other
> slower or not at all; calcite {104} face stepping as a DETERMINISTIC growth feature." The
> bigger axis than the optics goal — morphology emerging from ANISOTROPIC growth, the physics.
> **Root problem (verified in code):** a crystal's whole shape is two scalars + a habit string
> (`total_growth_um` → c_length/a_width, symmetric `mesh.scale.set(aWid,cLen,aWid)`); there is
> NO per-face distance, no second termination, no frozen-attached-end. Everything anisotropic
> we've shipped (gwindel, saddle, bent, sceptre) is a bespoke mesh, not per-face growth.
> **Handoff: `proposals/HANDOFF-DIRECTIONAL-GROWTH-2026-06-22.md`** (the current arc handoff — read
> it first; commits, data model, the float-vs-embed correction, where to pick up).
> **Full design doc: `proposals/PROPOSAL-DIRECTIONAL-GROWTH-2026-06-22.md`** (multi-agent
> research, 40+ citations verified, zero fabrications; physics cross-checked; catalog audit
> EXECUTED). **The destination = the central-distance / Wulff model** (crystal = ⋂ half-spaces
> {nᵢ·x ≤ dᵢ}, normals fixed by point group + lattice, only the distances dᵢ grow; "slow faces
> win"). **Staged, render-only first:** Phase 0 infra (3 null tags + pure classifiers,
> byte-identical) → Phase 1 first tenant = **calcite {104} directional macrostepping on
> elmwood** (anchor the 78°/102° obtuse-acute step pair to De Yoreo-Vekilov RiMG 54 first;
> calcite is centrosymmetric so this is ENVIRONMENTAL + surface-step anisotropy, NOT polarity)
> → Phase 2 substrate occlusion (the DOMINANT universal vug driver, its own field) → Phase 3
> intrinsic polarity for the FOUR real polar tenants (hemimorphite/wurtzite/tourmaline/
> **greenockite** — audit done; quartz cleared as enantiomorphic) → Phase 4 full Wulff
> ConvexGeometry. **Two design fixes baked in:** split `_occlusion` (extrinsic, all minerals)
> from `_polarAxis` (intrinsic, 10-class only) — never one scalar; and the convex model CANNOT
> do hopper/skeletal concavity → decide nested-shells primitive before generalizing. Open
> calibration debts: numerical obtuse/acute ratio-vs-Ca:CO₃ curve; per-mineral σ thresholds;
> a structured `point_group` field; world-frame-gradient vs random `_crystalYaw` coupling;
> terminal-specimen check of free-vs-attached macrostep contrast before shipping the carve.
> **PHASE 0 SHIPPED** (render-only rails, byte-identical, NO SIM bump): `_faceStep`/
> `_occlusion`/`_polarAxis` tag namespace documented in js/27 (NOT initialized — the
> _deformation/_etch precedent); js/45 `classifyFaceStep` (pure, rng-free, gated on
> `wall.directional_steps`); wired in js/85; js/99i terrace cache-sig conditional
> face-set token (appends nothing when absent).
> **PHASE 1 SHIPPED** (the visible payoff, render-only, byte-identical, NO SIM bump):
> elmwood opts in via `wall.directional_steps`; js/99i `_makeDirectionalTerracedCalciteGeom`
> (clone of the terrace builder with a per-segment radius — stepped face-set {0,1,2} holds
> the bold ledge, opposite set follows the smooth envelope), dispatched when `_faceStep`
> present. + js/92b/narratives directional_stepped prose + tests-js/facestep.test.ts (3 pins:
> dormancy via marble, field-absent, real elmwood opt-in). BROWSER-VERIFIED: side-view render
> of the real bundled builder shows one face-set staircased, opposite smooth (vs symmetric =
> stepped all around). elmwood seed-42 summary == committed v214 baseline (render-only). cold-ci
> GREEN. **CAUGHT:** WallState whitelists every flag → `directional_steps` was silently dropped
> until added to js/22 (the Phase-0 flag-injection test set it AFTER construction so missed it).
> **SPECIMEN-DEBT (owed):** shipped literature-anchored (78°/102° De Yoreo-Vekilov RiMG 54); a
> real calcite specimen showing free-vs-attached macrostep contrast is the terminal check, not
> yet done. **Honest caveats:** reads from the SIDE (stepped/smooth split is front/back, not
> head-on silhouette); face-set is yaw-arbitrary (→ reactive-morphology arc).
> **FUTURE — REACTIVE morphology** (boss directive, "later down the line"):
> directional (face-set arbitrary, yaw-relative) → reactive (face-set SELECTED by the
> environment). Three rungs, cheapest first: (1) void-normal orientation — `wall_anchor`
> outward normal points into the open void = a real geometric cause, removes most of the
> "arbitrary" with no new field; (2) flow/gravity-aware per scenario (growth_environment
> 'air' already exists); (3) full diffusion-field-reactive off the multidim cavity voxel
> σ-grid (where obtuse/acute could track real local Ca:CO₃). Proposal §4.
> **PHASE 3 SHIPPED** (intrinsic crystallographic polarity, render-only, byte-identical, NO SIM
> bump): js/45 `classifyPolarAxis` tags the four audited polar tenants (tourmaline 3m,
> hemimorphite mm2, wurtzite/greenockite 6mm) with `_polarAxis` — ALWAYS-ON (intrinsic, not
> opt-in), pure, byte-identical; quartz (class 32, enantiomorphic) correctly excluded. js/99i
> `_makeHemimorphicPrism` (dominant +c pyramid / flat -c pinacoid) dispatched on `_polarAxis` +
> prism/spike token, !geom so tourmaline's sector-zoned hourglass still wins. **This is mostly a
> BUG FIX:** greenockite's declared `hexagonal_pyramidal` habit fell through to a generic hex
> prism (the pyritohedral/octahedral_REE token-wart family) — and its narrator already promised
> "Hemimorphic hexagonal pyramid, different terminations top and bottom," so prose and geometry
> now AGREE (no narrator change needed). tests-js/polar-axis.test.ts (3 pins). BROWSER-VERIFIED
> greenockite: generic prism → pyramid-dominant hemimorphic form. cold-ci GREEN.
> **FLOAT-VS-EMBED CHECK DONE (2026-06-22) — Phase 2 RE-PROMOTED; my earlier "demoted" call was
> WRONG.** I had hypothesised the attached base is buried in the wall (→ termination features
> invisible → Phase 2/3 low-value). The check falsified it. The placement code (js/99i:4070-4081)
> floats the WHOLE crystal into the cavity: `offsetMm = cLen*0.5; position = anchor + cAxis·offset`
> with the comment "position the BASE at the anchor … so the crystal projects into the cavity
> rather than half-buried in the wall." Crystals do NOT embed — the base sits ON the surface and
> the full crystal (both terminations) is visible (confirmed by a live render: full free-standing
> prism perched base-on-surface). CONSEQUENCES: (a) Phase 3 polarity (just shipped) IS genuinely
> visible — both terminations show — so it was worth it; (b) **Phase 2 occlusion is a REAL visible
> improvement**, not marginal: real drusy crystals emerge single-terminated with the base merged
> into the matrix, but the sim shows the full free-standing crystal — embedding the attached
> fraction (sink ~40% into the wall, render the buried half short of full) is the fix. The error
> was reasoning from the BUILDERS (open/flat base) without reading the PLACEMENT (floats it out);
> the boss's "look before you assert" check corrected it. NEXT = boss decision: **Phase 2
> (occlusion, re-promoted)** or **Phase 4 (full per-face form)**. Phase 1 (azimuthal stepping) +
> Phase 3 (polarity) are the visible wins so far. Composes with the optics goal.
>
> ## 🏞️ SESSION (2026-06-22, later) — OPEN-SYSTEM EVAPORITE PLAIN + flooded selenite ✅ SHIPPED (SIM 214)
>
> Boss directive: "the salt plain shape should be its own unique shape that should not be
> something that can fill up and close — it's an evaporite plain." A defer-to-geology fix.
> **Diagnosis:** the earlier flooded-selenite attempt failed because great_salt_plains'
> selenite PACKED the 120mm basin by ~step 250 → the growth loop closed it (currentFill≥1.0
> → dissolution-only); a late flood saw σ=85 but had no room → flooded nothing. The real bug
> was the MODEL — a salt plain is an OPEN surface, not a sealed pocket. (The flat-playa
> GEOMETRY was already right: architecture:'basin'; only the fill-close was wrong.)
> **Fix:** new `wall.open_system` flag — js/22 WallState.open_system (default false); js/85
> reads cavity fill as 0 when set, so the plain never SEALS, keeps NUCLEATING, and never hits
> the fill-halt/dampener (growth stays rate-limited by chemistry, not pocket space). Default
> false → **baseline-diff 213↔214 = great_salt_plains ONLY** (crystals 30→28, species 5→5;
> 36 others byte-identical). Selenite now grows through ALL the cycles (30→95mm, terraces
> 3→5) instead of packing+halting. **+ flooded variant** (the original ask, now unblocked):
> gsp_flood red-mud iron event at step 265 (PAST the 250 baseline) — canonical 250-step run
> stays AMBER stepped (intensity 0.55, flooded 0); extended/creative run (330) → iron lands
> on the still-growing open plain → intensity 0.95 → both blades flooded chocolate-brown.
> The boss's "flood after the test length" plan, made to work by the open-system shape fix.
> + tests (canonical-amber + extended-flooded pins) + probe STEPS override. NEXT (open):
> open_system could suit other true open-surface scenarios (sabkha, searles playa) if wanted.
>
> ## ⟂ SESSION (2026-06-22, later) — CALCITE MECHANICAL e-TWIN OVERPRINT ✅ SHIPPED (SIM 213)
>
> Deformation/shear arc §5.3 next tenant — the calcite sibling of the v208 bent-quartz
> overprint, the second of the boss's "both in sequence" pickups. Calcite e-twins {01-12}
> are POST-growth crystal-plastic glide lamellae imposed on a finished lattice by later
> tectonic strain (the textbook Ferrill Type I-IV paleostress/temperature gauge; citations
> verified in RESEARCH-deformation-shear §4). Ships on the EXISTING deformation-directive
> plumbing — no classifier change: a scenario event carries deformation {style:'etwin',...};
> classifyDeformation (js/45) already tags any style → `_deformation.kind='etwin'`; js/99i
> `_makeTwinnedCalcite` SUBDIVIDES the scalenohedron (3 levels) and bakes parallel dark
> lamella stripes into vertex colours (the chiastolite/sector idiom), magnitude → lamella
> count + thickness (Ferrill I few → IV many). **TENANT: marble_contact_metamorphism** —
> the Mogok Stone Tract marble was regionally deformed in the Himalayan orogeny (~30 Ma); a
> new step-165 orogenic-strain event (post-seal) twins the already-grown calcite.
> minerals:['calcite'] — the ruby (twin-resistant corundum) is spared. (tormiq was the
> elegant first choice — its step-188 thrust already bends quartz — but its calcite is
> aspirational and doesn't fire at seed 42, so marble, the textbook e-twin host, is the
> home.) CHEMICALLY INERT (no-op handler) → baseline-diff 212↔213 = **0/37 drift**
> (provenance bump). 1 calcite tagged @seed42 (40mm dogtooth). + narrator (calcite
> 'e_twinned') + tests (etwin-overprint.test.ts, 4 pins) + tools/etwin-probe.mjs +
> standalone-render verified (parallel lamellae vs smooth reference). NEXT overprint
> tenants (same pass): bent stibnite (needs stibnite in a scenario); undulose/strain-band
> overlay. Deformation arc §5.3 now has TWO tenants (bent quartz + calcite e-twins).
>
> ## 🪓 SESSION (2026-06-22, later) — ETCH-PIT / DISSOLUTION SCULPTURE ✅ SHIPPED (SIM 212)
>
> Crystal-face-realism arc §2, the flagged best value-per-effort. The §2 premise was that
> the etched look was a PASSIVE read of existing resorption ("the state is there, only the
> render is missing"). **A census (tools/etch-pit-probe.mjs) FALSIFIED that** — the engine's
> dissolution is BINARY: a crystal either survives ~intact (resorbed frac ~0.00) or fully
> dissolves and DROPS from the scene (js/99i culls dissolved crystals). 163 crystals fully
> dissolve fleet-wide; the "survivors" with resorption zones are all frac ≤0.01 or net ≈0.
> There is NO population of substantially-etched survivors to render.
>
> So etching ships as a **DECLARED post-growth overprint** — the same shape as the v208
> deformation/bent mechanic, geologically honest (a returning undersaturated fluid corrodes
> a FINISHED crystal): a scenario event carries an `etch` directive {amount,minerals,style};
> apply_events (js/85d) records it on `sim._etchEvents`; classifyEtch (js/45) tags surviving
> crystals that grew before that step; js/99i `_makeEtchedCube` rounds a SUBDIVIDED box
> toward a sphere (corners round most — a low-poly cube can't round) + frosts the material
> (Sangwal 1987; lead-with-rounding per §2). Runs BEFORE the terrace render (corrosion
> rounds AWAY growth relief). Gated on the cube token (fluorite/galena; octahedron a future
> extension). **TENANT: reactivated_fluorite_vein** — the breach (step 118) reopens the
> conduit, the returning fluid etches the gen-1 fluorite + galena cubes before gen-2
> overgrows them (etched-then-overgrown texture of reactivated North-Pennine veins). 5
> crystals tagged @seed42 (fluorite×1 6.2mm, galena×4). CHEMICALLY INERT → baseline-diff
> 211↔212 = **0/37 drift** (provenance bump, v208 precedent). + narrator (fluorite/galena
> 'etched') + tests (etch-overprint.test.ts) + standalone-render verified (rounded, frosted
> dissolved cubes). NEXT (open): etched OCTAHEDRON render; etch as a general optical state
> feeding the new optics goal.

> ## 🏜️ SESSION HANDOFF (2026-06-22, later) — HOURGLASS SELENITE ✅ SHIPPED (render SIM-neutral `50f4c51` + great_salt_plains SIM 211)
>
> The crystal-face-realism arc's first GENUINELY VISIBLE sector tenant — and the one
> apophyllite turned out NOT to be. Boss opened by sharing four of his own provenance-
> locked specimens (the image-corpus method, but firsthand): radiating brown rosette
> sprays + a stepped translucent hourglass blade.
>
> **✅ STEP 1 — visible hourglass render, SIM-neutral (`50f4c51`, Pages-verified).**
> Selenite was already in the catalogue. js/45 classifySectorZoning + _seleniteHourglassParams
> tag a blade `gypsum_hourglass` from the engine's EXISTING hourglass-inclusion zones
> (no new RNG/chemistry → baseline byte-identical); js/99i _makeHourglassSeleniteBlade
> renders the amber→chocolate sandglass (|zn|<|yn|: wide at the tips, pinched at the

> +narrator +tests +tools/gypsum-hourglass-probe.mjs. Standalone-scene render verified.
>
> **✅ STEP 2 — great_salt_plains showcase (SIM 211).** Salt Plains NWR, Oklahoma — the
> ONLY place on Earth selenite grows the iron-stained hourglass (the state crystal).
> Wet/dry seasonal cycling on Permian red beds: dry bursts wick gypsum+iron brine up
> and evaporate fast (trap sediment + a growth burst), wet pauses dilute below gypsum
> saturation → the blade grows in gap-separated bursts → STEPPED ziggurat (steps 3 @
> seed42), red-bed iron stains it deep brown (intensity ~0.53). Boss asked for chisel
> tips WITH stepped-growth (per his pic 4); both shipped. Classifier refined to re-eval
> each step (the hourglass evolves with growth) + decoupled intensity (iron-driven brown)
> from flooded (trapped-fraction). Baseline-diff v210→v211: 36 prior scenarios BYTE-
> IDENTICAL, great_salt_plains the one new entry (5 species, 30 crystals).
>
> **Arc symmetry worth keeping:** apophyllite's sector zoning was OPTICAL-only → uniform
> render; selenite's is genuinely VISIBLE → sector-partitioned render. The arc finally
> has its visible-sector tenant. NEXT (open): the in-app great_salt_plains showcase
> screenshot for the boss's eye; possible chisel/spear polish + a flooded-variant seed.

> ## 🟢 SESSION HANDOFF (2026-06-22) — GREEN APOPHYLLITE ✅ SHIPPED (SIM 210) · hourglass GYPSUM QUEUED
>
> **Current handoff doc: `proposals/HANDOFF-APOPHYLLITE-AND-GYPSUM-2026-06-22.md`**
> (read it first — the cross-check trail, the reusable image-corpus method, the gypsum
> sub-arc plan + the boss's design envelope, the traps, + the maker's mark).
>
> **✅ STEP 3 SHIPPED — green apophyllite.** Arc went augite → apophyllite (augite
> REJECTED: magmatic phenocryst, breaks the vug premise). `1710ac0` SIM 210 (V⁴⁺ green
> dispatcher + deccan V=3, 60→59 crystals/species 17→17, 35 scenarios byte-identical)
> + `45ca65c` SIM-neutral (uniform-green render correction). Both Pages-verified.
> THREE cross-check corrections, an error caught at each: chromophore Cu→**V⁴⁺**
> (Rossman 1974, the handoff's Cu was a confabulation); my "not real sector zoning"→
> it IS, but **optically only** (anomalous birefringence); and an **image corpus** of
> Pune specimens proved the visible green is a **UNIFORM body colour** (no visible
> sector partition) → render corrected from two-tone to uniform green + pearly basal
> luster. Apophyllite is a uniform-green COLOUR variety, NOT a visible-sector tenant.
>
> **○ NEXT QUEUED — hourglass GYPSUM (selenite)**, the real VISIBLE-sector vug tenant.
> Clay/anhydrite-inclusion growth sectors → a genuine visible hourglass ("hourglass
> selenite"). Boss design envelope (firsthand): visible even near-clear; VARIABLE (not
> every specimen) → model as a variant (clear-with-hourglass ↔ inclusion-flooded brown
> via overgrowth). Preflight: gypsum/selenite is likely already in the catalogue (a
> habit-variant + render + scenario job, not a new mineral). Research-first + image-
> corpus the visible geometry before rendering. **Fresh session recommended.**
>
> **Reusable method captured this session — the IMAGE-CORPUS check:** when the
> literature won't pin a VISUAL detail, gather a provenance-locked specimen-image
> corpus (agent finds direct URLs; curl to temp; VIEW yourself; filter by provenance;
> never commit the images) and report the pattern even when it contradicts what you
> shipped. It caught the apophyllite render error.

> ## ✚ SESSION HANDOFF (2026-06-21, later) — ANDALUSITE + CHIASTOLITE CROSS ✅ SHIPPED (SIM 209)

>
> **Master doc: `proposals/PROPOSALS-crystal-face-realism-2026-06-21.md` §1** (SHIPPED

> **✅ SHIPPED — sector zoning Tier A, render-only, SIM-NEUTRAL, byte-identical (0/35).**

> ## ⛰️ SESSION HANDOFF (2026-06-19) — THE ALPINE-CLEFT ARC ✅ SHIPPED (Grimsel SIM 206)
>
> **Master doc: `proposals/HANDOFF-ALPINE-CLEFT-2026-06-19.md`** (read it). The
> quartz-morphology arc (§A #8) was reshaped — scouting proved fenster
> content-blocked (quartz σ = silica-abundance), so we built the content home: a
> Grimsel/Aar Swiss alpine cleft, and rode the honest variants on it.
>
> **✅ SHIPPED v206 — `grimsel_alpine_cleft` + quartz morphology & variants.**
> - **SCEPTRE** (the headline): `grow_quartz` dissolves at σ<1, so a crack-seal
>   SEAL corrodes the gen-1 tip and the BREACH regenerates a wider gen-2 cap on
>   ONE crystal — resorption→renewal across a phantom boundary (NOT a step-gap;
>   EXTENT not rate — the cooler cap is slower/step yet larger). js/45
>   classifyQuartzSceptre + js/99i two-body render + `tools/quartz-sceptre-scan.mjs`.
>   3 robust sceptres/seed.
> - **SMOKY/MORION**: radiogenic-host γ-dose + Al (Rossman 1994) — a FLEET-WIDE
>   colour fix (granite/pegmatite quartz now smoky; the prior model only dosed
>   quartz beside a uraninite crystal). Colour only, zero assemblage churn.
> - **TESSIN**: steep-rhomb face form on cleft quartz.
> - **Blocker fixed**: dilute-broth correction (K 120→30, Na 80→25, Al 12→6) — the
>   prior broth grew an 18 mm feldspar / 7 mm albite that ENCLOSED the quartz
>   (geologically inverted). Full assemblage now fires (quartz/feldspar/titanite/
>   hematite/fluorite/apatite/calcite + epidote).
> - **GWINDEL ✅ SHIPPED v207** (2026-06-20): the alpine-fissure twisted column —
>   Grimsel/Aar is the world type locality. The boss corrected the v206 deferral:
>   a gwindel is distinguished CRYSTALLOGRAPHICALLY (the a-axis twist), not by
>   fluid history (cleft crystals share the fluid), so it ships as a habit variant
>   — the largest cleft showpiece, twist ∝ growth duration (js/45 + js/99i +
>   wall.alpine_cleft flag js/22). 1 gwindel + 2 sceptres in grimsel; 0/35
>   baseline drift (habit/render tag).
> - **NOT shipped (one honest gap left):** FENSTER — quartz σ is silica abundance,
>   so an occupied band would mislabel slow pegmatites (the content-block stands).
>   Needs a genuine growth-rate-instability driver. Documented in
>   RESEARCH-quartz-morphology §6.
> - **titanite** (SIM 205, `6f5627a`) was the prerequisite (de-orphans §A #13).
>
> Baselines: v206 only grimsel moved (0→11 species, smoky colour-only fleet-wide);
> v207 gwindel = 0/35 drift.
>
> **NEXT ARC (boss-chosen 2026-06-20): a real DEFORMATION / SHEAR FIELD.** Gwindel
> v207 is an honest abstraction (largest cleft quartz = the twist, no stress field);
> the boss wants the real mechanic. It's a declared movement field (the T/Eh idiom,
> js/85j) that crystals integrate per-zone as they grow → true gwindel torsion +
> bent/curved crystals + saddle dolomite + strain-band zone tags. **Full design +
> knowledge transfer in `HANDOFF-ALPINE-CLEFT-2026-06-19.md` §8** (read it first).

> ## 🔬 UPDATE (2026-06-13) — REDOX-GATE OMISSION SWEEP: census DONE (2 real catches), fix HELD on an RNG prerequisite
>
> **Task #59.** The vanadinite catch (v193 — a redox-sensitive species whose
> engine was cloned without its redox gate) prompted a systematic census.
> **NEW: tools/redox-gate-census.mjs** — 166 supersaturation engines swept; a
> curated redox-class map (the geology: which oxidation state each diagnostic
> ion sits in) × mechanical gate-detection. It found EXACTLY two HIGH
> structural omissions: **sphalerite + wurtzite** — ZnS sulfides with no
> `sulfideRedoxAnoxic` gate, the last siblings of the omission galena carried
> until v13 ("a clear physics bug"). (native_gold was the lone INFO flag —
> gold is redox-robust, intentionally ungated; left as-is.)
>
> **The fix is correct physics but HELD — here's why (the science led here).**
> Dark-observe (**tools/sulfide-redox-omission-probe.mjs**): the gate bites
> ONLY supergene_oxidation (sphalerite σ>0 at O2 up to 2.2 in the Tsumeb
> gossan; everywhere else sphalerite/wurtzite fire only in reducing fluid, so
> the gate is inert). But adding it re-rolls supergene's shared-RNG cascade
> and demotes **mottramite 96% → 47% of seeds** (**tools/mottramite-frequency-
> sweep.mjs**, pre/post paired, 100 seeds). mottramite shares NO ion with ZnS
> → this is pure RNG-sequencing displacement, not chemistry. Confirmed: a
> Tsumeb-justified V-seep bump (+6→+13) raised mottramite's mean count but NOT
> its frequency (still 47%) — no chemistry lever can restore an RNG artifact.
> mottramite is a genuine abundant Tsumeb phase (Boni 2007), so 47% is a real
> under-representation. Net: shipping the gate now trades a modest gain (one
> sphalerite's overgrowth, 804→241µm) for a larger artifact-driven regression.
>
> **PREREQUISITE for the gate to land: per-mineral derived nucleation seeds**
> (the 15th-catch "scramble derived seeds" class) so gating one mineral can't
> scramble another's draws. Once that exists, the sphalerite/wurtzite gate
> lands clean. RIDER: Tsumeb's V-seep IS under-cooked (it reaches 7.5 vs
> minor-occurrence Caldbeck's 14; Tsumeb is a world-class vanadate locality) —
> a standalone V-richness correction (vanadinite stayed healthy at mean 6.0,
> arsenates intact in the experiment) to pair with the gate when it lands.
> The vugg-canary nightly sweep (PROPOSAL drafted) is the instrument that
> would validate the gate+RNG-derivation lands without regressions.
>
> **Shipped this session (pure tooling, no engine change, no SIM bump):** the
> three tools above. The census is the durable deliverable; the fix is scoped.
>
> **⭐ QUEUED NEXT — THE KEYSTONE ARC: per-mineral derived nucleation seeds.**
> This session promoted it from a footnote to the bottleneck. The held
> sphalerite/wurtzite gate isn't a one-off: because nucleation draws from one
> shared RNG stream, ANY gate change / engine retune to a high-traffic mineral
> re-rolls the whole cascade and can knock out unrelated abundant phases
> (mottramite 96→47% was the demonstrator). So a whole CLASS of correct
> physics fixes is currently unshippable. The fix: derive each mineral's
> nucleation RNG per-(mineral, cell) — the 15th-catch "scramble derived seeds"
> idea (already done for the MOVEMENT stream) extended to NUCLEATION. Natural
> sequence for the next stretch: **build vugg-canary → land RNG-derivation →
> then the held gate + future redox fixes land clean AND auto-validated.** The
> canary is what makes the RNG-derivation arc safe to attempt (it catches a
> regression at 04:00 instead of needing a hand-run sweep).

>
> The "EVENT-CONFOUNDED redox" gated class (bisbee/schneeberg) is now
> CLOSED — both members subsumed in one session. **bisbee shipped (SIM

> ## 💎 UPDATE (2026-06-10, earlier) — NAICA'S THERMAL STORY (SIM 182): the first declared temperature movement
>
> The first consumer of the v181 unlock, shipped the same day. naica's
> buffered pool is now a DECLARED movement (base 56°C, smoothstep −3 over
> steps 0-260, NO OU texture — Naica's fluid-inclusion record shows a
> steady bath, so no-noise IS the science) + `thermal_pulses:false` +
> `cooling_rate:0.1` for the post-drainage era (the mining events own T
> after 260 — the thermal buffer was the WATER). The six slow_cooling
> events keep their chemistry half (anhydrite Ca/S resupply); their −0.7°C
> drops are superseded: **events are the chemistry beats, the movement is
> the thermal sentence.** Dark-observed first (tools/naica-thermal-observe.mjs,
> 3 seeds): García-Ruiz band occupancy 0→50%, selenite sweet-spot 0→31%,
> pulses 13-18→0 — and the García-Ruiz mechanism EMERGED rather than being
> scripted: total crystal count dropped ~40-60% (27→11, 39→16) while the
> cavity still seals. Fewer nuclei, larger individuals. The low-T noise
> feeders (opal, goethite, lepidocrocite, tigers_eye, pyrolusite) drop
> out; the cave trends toward its real near-monomineralic character.
> Single-scenario rebake (1/31 moved, fleet byte-identical), coverage
> unchanged (133 live / 2 stale / 36 dead), strip contracts hold and mean
> more now (the isothermal brine the SI pin always assumed is finally the
> recorded trajectory).
>
> **SAME DAY, v183 — gem_pegmatite + THE ROLLOUT CLASSIFICATION.** Mapping
> gem_pegmatite found the second shape: its eight events SET temperature
> (620→…→300 — the documented three-phase curve is already fully
> event-anchored), so a movement would CLOBBER a working design. Scenarios
> carry T stories in TWO SHAPES: **naica-shape** (events don't own T →
> declare a movement) vs **pegmatite-shape** (events anchor T → silence the
> ambient noise: thermal_pulses:false ± cooling_rate). gem_pegmatite got
> the flag (sealed miarolitic pocket = no fracture injections; pulse Fe
> riders were fighting the li_phase Fe-depletion that makes elbaite; a late
> pulse re-warmed the ended system to 476°C vs the 300°C floor). Measured
> BYTE-IDENTICAL baseline (seals before the divergence reaches records) —
> bump for the live T channel. **And the v181 decoupling visibly worked:
> the flag re-rolled NOTHING** (pre-v181 it would have re-rolled the whole
> scenario). New general instrument: `tools/t-story-observe.mjs` (BASE vs
> flags/movement, expects-survival check — supersedes the naica-specific
> observer). REMAINING CLASSIFICATION (from the T-setter grep): marble
> (700/500/350), deccan (200→80 ×5), radioactive_pegmatite (450→18 ×11)
> are pegmatite-shape → observe-then-flag, one arc each, expect
> near-neutral rebakes. `cooling` (events:[]) is pure naica-shape — a
> declared Herkimer burial-T story. porphyry + epithermal: mixed/unmapped,
> observe first.

>
> Part II's next-step #2 is DECIDED AND DONE — retire, not restore (the
> boss's standing v157 direction: "mesh.cells is the way to go"). The

> ## ⚡ UPDATE (2026-06-10, earlier) — MOVEMENTS GATE CLEARED: ehFromO2 ↔ o2FromEh exact (SIM-NEUTRAL)
>
> Part II's next-step #1 is DONE. The 10× saturation-slope asymmetry above
> the top anchor (`ehFromO2` rose at 100 mV/decade past O2=5 while
> `o2FromEh` came back at 1000 — each author had picked "gentle" in their

> 1000 mV/decade. An Eh-canonical movement writing +800 mV now survives
> the window-close round trip EXACTLY (was: snapped to +530). 1000 won
> over 100 because the inverse keeps synthetic O2 physical across the
> whole Eh domain (+900 mV → 12.6 ppm ≈ air-saturated water; slope-100

> First execution of the handoff's tune pass (`12a0b09`): the headline
> azure-blue specimen grows (0→2x, ~2.2 mm) + leadhillite caps (0→2x).
> **Stale 7 → 4.** The v109 "Shape B structural" diagnosis had ROTTED — the

> **SAME SESSION, 13th CATCH — the tune pass is COMPLETE, stale 4 → 2:**

> ## ⚒️ UPDATE (2026-06-09, later) — REBAKE ARC SHIPPED: v177 + v178 + v179
>
> The three calibration-coupled fixes from the review below are DONE
> (`51487a4` / `61bef7c` / `503e228`, all suites 1769/1769):
> - **v177 cell-key:** per-cell competition grouping fixed. The measured truth
>   (new `tools/graduated-binding-probe.mjs` + `_gradCompStats` telemetry, run
>   both ways): rationing binds 199/80,649 allocations (0.25%), ONLY in
>   same-cell stacks, identically under both keys → seed-42 baselines
>   byte-identical; the bug was output-LATENT. It matters when budgets tighten.
> - **v178 PWP Ea:** array was a PERMUTATION (acid↔carbonate), corrected to
>   [k1 14.4, k2 35.4, k3 23.5] + `_PWP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR` re-anchored 5.0e4
>   → 1.9e4 (the factor was tuned under the wrong Ea; response to the factor is
>   SUPER-linear, naive linear rescale overshot). 13/31 scenarios move,
>   carbonate-centric; mvt + vein identity minerals byte-identical. ALSO fixed:
>   week-11's HMC Arrhenius test had an UNDERSATURATED fixture — a green test
>   was load-bearing for the wrong physics.
> - **v179 vein seal:** `thermal_pulses:false` + non-heating Math.max(Math.min)
>   floors + NEW opt-in `wall.cooling_rate` knob (default 1.5, RNG-neutral; the
>   vein sets 0.4 — an open feeder advects heat, so a live vein holds near
>   brine T until the conduit chokes). Sealed interval now genuinely quiet
>   (111→104 °C, flow 0.05, zero injections); both generations inside North
>   Pennine fluid-inclusion T (~90-150 °C). 1/31 baselines moved.
> - **SWEEP MOVEMENT: stale 8 → 7 (borax recovered at searles_lake), dead
>   35 → 34 (tremolite revived).** Remaining 7 stale are vugg-tune-scenario
>   candidates, NOT engine bugs: roughten_gill's four (linarite, leadhillite,
>   mottramite, bayldonite), jeffrey magnetite, searles mirabilite, schneeberg
>   torbernite (0/10 seeds; zeunerite thin at 2/10). bisbee azurite verified
>   gate-not-cleared (its azurite_peak event fires, the mineral never
>   nucleates) — do NOT just add it to expects_species; tune first.
> - **Tune-watch items from the v178 rebake:** jeffrey lost aragonite+siderite
>   (not in expects), deccan gained a 1-crystal wollastonite (suspect at
>   zeolite T), w9-probe trap documented in 52b (its printed columns bake in
>   the LIVE factor).
> - Still open from the review: §1.4 ring_fluids retire-or-restore decision
>   (✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-10 — retired to a derived view, see 🪞 banner),

> ## 🔍 UPDATE (2026-06-09) — THREE-METRICS REVIEW: bugs / accuracy / Steam-readiness
>
> A cold-eyes review sweep on the boss's three metrics. **Full report:
> `proposals/REVIEW-THREE-METRICS-2026-06-09.md`** — read it before picking up
> any item below. Fixed in the pass (both SIM-NEUTRAL): the committed bundle
> was STALE (npm run ci was RED since c1b161e — same-length comment drift hid
> as "diff length: 0 chars") and the four v165 sulfate SI chips were
> unreachable in the Strip View chip selector (hardcoded systems list; new
> probe `tools/strip-chip-selector-probe.mjs` guards it). New OPEN items:
> - **HIGH bug:** graduated-competition cell key collapses to per-ring with an
>   arbitrary budget fluid (`85b` `_computeGraduatedZones` — WallCell has no
>   id/idx/vertexIdx). One-line fix, but CALIBRATION-REBAKING; shipping since
>   v128c. May be suppressing some of the 8 stale expects_species — fix, then
>   re-sweep.
> - **HIGH accuracy:** PWP activation energies paired to the WRONG mechanisms
>   (`thermo-carbonates.json` + `52b`): correct [k1,k2,k3] = [14.4, 35.4, 23.5]
>   kJ/mol (P&K 2004 assigns acid=14.4); shipped array is reversed → hot acid
>   scenarios over-amplify ~12×. Rebake with the cell-key fix as ONE arc.
> - **MED:** `_propagateGlobalDelta` no longer reaches non-equator ring_fluids
>   (stale store still read by open-atmosphere pH, Eh sync, replay snapshots —
>   retire it or restore the loop, no third partial mirror); carbonate pK(T)
>   slopes ~5-10× too flat (`20b`); reactivated_fluorite_vein needs
>   `thermal_pulses:false` + a non-heating seal floor; 8 stale expects_species
>   are locality-fidelity breaks (searles borax/mirabilite, roughten_gill
>   linarite/leadhillite/mottramite/bayldonite, jeffrey magnetite, schneeberg
>   torbernite) + bisbee expects omits azurite.
> - **MOVEMENTS BLOCKER:** ehFromO2/o2FromEh are 10× asymmetric above O2=5
>   (`20c`) — an Eh +800 mV movement snaps back to +530 when its window closes.
>   Align slopes before Movements Phase 1 drives Eh. *(✅ FIXED 2026-06-10 —
>   see the ⚡ banner above; +800 now round-trips exactly.)*
> - **Narrator/spec one-liners (afternoon, SIM-NEUTRAL):** wurtzite 95 °C
>   "boundary" myth, flos-ferri is aragonite not calcite, Statue of Liberty
>   patina is brochantite/antlerite not malachite, hiddenite is N. Carolina,
>   + ~10 more tabled in the report §2.4.
> - **Steam:** verdict "sim core is ready; the game around it is 3-5 months."

>
> The "2d breach API — wire a seal-then-reopen scenario" open item is **DONE**
> (`c1b161e`, live on Syntaxswine Pages). New scenario `reactivated_fluorite_vein`:
> a crack-seal reactivated vug (North-Pennine fluorite-galena-barite style) that

> conduit, `spots:'seal'`@78), then BREACHES them open again (tectonic
> reactivation, `spots:'breach'`@118) for a cooler gen-2. Lights up the breach
> API that was wired+tested but unused. No new engine — stage 1 reuses the proven
> mvt-analog brine + generic events; handlers in js/70t. Seed-42: 62 crystals /
> 16 species, all 5 expects fire (fluorite/galena/barite/calcite/sphalerite +
> wurtzite). ZERO cascade drift (additive). Suite 1761→1769. Full 7-file
> add-scenario pipeline + 3 menu surfaces (guard test green).
> - **Open from this arc:** (1) fluorite fires only 1 crystal even at 5× F — its
>   limiter is nucleation competition/cap, not F; present-but-minor, a
>   vugg-tune-scenario candidate if the boss wants fluorite dominant. (2) the
>   `breach` predicate-by-kind path (`spots:{action,kind}`) is exercised only with

> ## 🏛️ UPDATE (2026-06-05) — fresh full-orientation handoff written; READ IT FIRST
>
> **`proposals/HANDOFF-TO-THE-NEXT-BUILDER-2026-06-05.md`** is a complete, from-zero
> orientation for a builder who knows nothing: the JS-only law, the build pipeline
> (js/ → index.html), the subsystem map, every tool/probe + the five vugg-* skills
> and when to invoke them, the corrected deploy model (push-to-Syntaxswine IS the
> deploy; confirm the Pages build before "go look"), SIM_VERSION + baselines + the

> where the depletion-voice session left off. Grounded against current source via a
> survey workflow, authored in-voice. New builder: start there, then this BACKLOG
> for fine-grained open items.
>
> ## ▽ UPDATE (2026-06-04) — the DEPLETION VOICE ships (SIM-neutral)
>
> The audible twin of the floor shadow (open item #1 from the SIM-175 banner
> below, now done) is built: a soft SHADOW oscillator per chip, sounding at the
> deepest depleted pocket's pitch, swelling where a crystal draws the broth down.
> It shares the chip's lvlGain (pans + rescales with the voice), bypasses artGain
> (a sustained undertone, not a pluck), sits a few cents flat (a faint beat where
> the gap is near-unison, a real interval where the halo is deep), and SELF-GATES
> to silence on abundant/absent ions. Toggle: ▽ Depletion (default ON), restarts a
> live performance like the 🔔 crystals layer. Engine in js/85i; UI in js/99k.
> SIM-neutral (reads recorded floor_data only — no engine output touched, no
> SIM_VERSION bump, no baseline regen). Full suite 1761/1761.
>
> **THE KEY MEASUREMENT (tools/sonify-depletion-probe.mjs — built first, it tuned
> the design):** the recorded halos are REAL but small in ABSOLUTE normalized
> terms — a limiting ion sits near the bottom of its own declared color-range, so
> a 20-49% local drawdown is only a ~1-10% band height. Two load-bearing consequences:
> - **Reduction must be GLOBAL-MIN, not a mean.** A halo is local (one crystal);
>   averaging — even a per-height ring-mean — re-dilutes it (mvt Cd's 49% halo
>   showed as 2% under mean-of-ring-min). The single deepest pocket is what the eye
>   catches and what the ear now tracks.
> - **Loudness keys on RELATIVE drawdown (depth/level), not absolute.** That's the
>   range-independent physical "how hard was this pocket sucked dry," and it's what
>   separates limiting ions (big relative dip) from abundant ones (broth barely

## 🏗️ Modular refactor — split the monoliths ✅ SHIPPED (B1–B20, 2026-05-05)

**Status:** done. See `proposals/PROPOSAL-MODULAR-REFACTOR.md` (with its
SHIPPED footer) and [`js/README.md`](../js/README.md) for the navigable
index of the new source tree.

What landed:
- **Python (Phase A1–A5b, partial):** `vugg.py` 20,445 lines → `vugg/`
  package. `version.py`, `chemistry/{fluid,conditions}.py` + 12
  per-class supersat mixins, `geometry/{wall,crystal}.py`. The remaining
  Python phases (A6 engines, A7 transitions/events/scenarios, A8 simulator
  residual) paused when the user pivoted to JS-first.
- **JavaScript (Phase B1–B20, complete):** the 21,923-line inline
  `<script>` in `index.html` → 100+ TypeScript modules under `js/`,
  none over 1,000 lines. Includes build infra (`tools/build.mjs`
  concatenator + `tsc`), `npm run ci` regression guard, and zero type
  errors at landing.
- **Real bug fixes uncovered along the way (8):** `initR` undefined ref
  in 3D renderer; 3 duplicate narrator definitions (dead code); 5
  latent cross-block scope leaks in `check_nucleation` (only-correct-by-
  coincidence).

Adding a new mineral now takes ≤ 4 file touches (down from 8+) — see
[`js/README.md` Quick task lookup](../js/README.md#quick-task-lookup).

### Open follow-ups (small, well-scoped)

- **JS narrators for borax / tincalconite / halite / mirabilite / thenardite.**
  Python has them; JS doesn't. `narrate()`'s dynamic dispatch falls
  through to `''` for these 5 minerals. Port from
  `vugg/__init__.py`'s `_narrate_*` methods (~1 hour). Lands in:
  - `js/92c-narrators-halide.ts` ← `_narrate_halite`
  - `js/92j-narrators-sulfate.ts` ← `_narrate_mirabilite`, `_narrate_thenardite`
  - new `js/92l-narrators-borate.ts` ← `_narrate_borax`, `_narrate_tincalconite`
- **Finish Python A6–A8** (engines / transitions / simulator residual).
  Harness is functional as-is; this is future-proofing the test side.
  Mechanical extraction script is in this commit history (B15 / B17 / B20
  on the JS side use the same shape).
- **Tighten remaining `[key: string]: any;` index signatures.** Each
  dataclass-style class (FluidChemistry, VugConditions, WallState,
  Crystal, VugSimulator) has the loose signature added in B14b.
  Replacing with explicit field declarations would catch typos at
  compile time. Per-file work, no risk.

Order is rough priority — top of each section is most-actionable, but explicit user direction reorders freely.

## 🧪 Geological accuracy — closing the formal gaps

**Status:** Phases 1 + 2 ✅ SHIPPED (May 2026, SIM_VERSION 17→21). Phases 3-6 not yet started. See [`PROPOSAL-GEOLOGICAL-ACCURACY.md`](PROPOSAL-GEOLOGICAL-ACCURACY.md). **Overlaps with `PROPOSAL-VOLATILE-GASES.md`** (Rock Bot, 2026-05-04, on canonical) at Phases 3 (CO₂) and 4 (Eh/redox); cross-references in both directions are wired into the proposal text. Treat the two as one combined work package: VOLATILE-GASES owns the multi-species headspace state, this proposal owns mass balance + thermodynamic Q/K + aqueous-side speciation + solid solutions.

### What landed (Phases 1 + 2)

**Phase 1 — Fluid mass balance** (commits 08140d1 / 1eaaa5a / 7904894):
- `MINERAL_STOICHIOMETRY` table covers all 97 minerals (`js/19-mineral-stoichiometry.ts`)
- `applyMassBalance` wrapper in `_runEngineForCrystal` debits the per-ring fluid by stoichiometry × `MASS_BALANCE_SCALE = 0.01` on every precipitation step
- Engine-internal growth-path debits (15 lines across 5 files for adamite, mimetite, malachite, smithsonite, wulfenite, uraninite, feldspar) removed in Phase 1d to end double-counting; wrapper narrowed to precipitation-only so engine dissolution credits keep their per-mineral rates
- SIM_VERSION 17 → 18 → 19 → 21

**Phase 2 — Saturation Index reform** (commits 568476f / b63e426 / 4938321 / eff8ec1 / ed2a381):
- Carbonate Liebig bugfix: `min(M, X)` → `√(M·X)` for 5 supersat methods (calcite, siderite, rhodochrosite, aragonite, dolomite)
- Davies activity-coefficient infrastructure (`js/20a-chemistry-activity.ts`) — `ionicStrength`, `daviesLogGamma` (clamped above I=1.7 as documented degraded fallback), `activityCorrectionFactor`
- All 12 supersat classes migrated; activity correction runs on every supersat call at `ACTIVITY_DAMPING = 0.25` (a quarter of full Davies — the empirical sweet spot that keeps tutorials intact while applying real activity physics in saline scenarios)
- SIM_VERSION → 20

**Calibration outcome (sweep at seed 42):** v21 vs v20 RMS 7.6%, 15 of 19 scenarios within ±5%, 18 of 19 within ±20%. Outliers (mvt, bisbee, schneeberg) trace to genuine geological behavior — saline brines correctly less supersaturated under Davies; finite Fe/S pools deplete during sulfide cascades.

**Bug fixes uncovered along the way (3):**
- Davies runaway (γ = 49 million) above I ≈ 1.7 mol/kg — clamped log γ ≤ 0
- Carbonate `min(Ca, CO3)` Liebig pattern (5 sites)
- Migration script regex spillover at delegating supersat methods (caught before commit, reverted, manual fix)

### Open follow-ups (Phases 1e + 2d, on this same ticket)

- **Phase 1e — unify dissolution credits.** ~120 hand-coded `conditions.fluid.X += dissolved_um * coef` lines across ~10 engine files use per-mineral rates ~50× larger than `MASS_BALANCE_SCALE`. Migrate them into a parallel `MINERAL_DISSOLUTION_RATES` table so the wrapper owns both directions, then let the wrapper credit on negative thickness too. Mechanical per-mineral work; would let `MASS_BALANCE_SCALE` rise back toward the originally-prototyped 0.05 with full bidirectional control.
- **Phase 2d — per-scenario fluid recalibration.** The 3 Phase-2 outliers (mvt -33%, bisbee -25%, schneeberg) are stories where activity-corrected Davies suppresses marginal nucleations. Bump fluid concentrations in those scenarios so the affected minerals re-cross threshold, then ratchet `ACTIVITY_DAMPING` up toward 0.5+ (more honest physics with the recalibrated fluids).
- **Depletion-event log lines.** "Fe²⁺ depleted in ring 4 — pyrite nucleation halted" narratives whenever `applyMassBalance` floors a species at 0. Currently silent.

### Phases 3-6 (not started)

3. Carbonate speciation + CO₂ degassing as a first-class precipitation driver. New `co2_degas` event type. Travertine tutorial scenario. **Couples with VOLATILE-GASES Mechanic 2 — same gap, share the headspace state vector.**
4. pH/Eh as dynamic state variables driven by reactions; three explicit redox couples (Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺, Mn⁴⁺/Mn²⁺, SO₄²⁻/HS⁻). **Couples with VOLATILE-GASES Mechanic 1 — continuous Eh subsumes the discrete `redox_state` bucket.**
5. Solid-solution composition tracking — replaces broth-ratio branching with continuous mole-fraction, unifies the rhomb-carbonate and sphalerite series.
6. Classical-Nucleation-Theory rate gates (optional, lowest priority).

**Adjacent angles** (not phases, but compose well): stable-isotope tracking (δ¹⁸O/δ¹³C), fluid-inclusion homogenization-T narration, Pitzer for high-salinity brines, Ostwald ripening (Phase 1 unblocks `PROPOSAL-GIBBS-THOMPSON.md`).

**Sequencing:** Phases 1+2 done; Phase 3 next (highest visible payoff). 3D-SIMULATION Phase D (orientation-bias habits) and the twin-probability retune both want Phase 5 first if they want continuous composition vectors.

## 🐞 Bugs / pending diagnostic

### 3D viewer bug list
**Status:** awaiting user's enumeration.
**Context:** during the 3D viewer work earlier in the project, several specific bugs were noted but never logged with reproduction steps. User has the list; this todo is the placeholder until they share it.

## 🌀 Twin probability retune — measure prevalence by per-mineral lifetime

**Status:** deferred, raised by user during the twin bug-fix commits (commits `8b8449b` per-nucleation roll fix + `16b39ee` four-placeholder population).

**Why:** the values currently in `data/minerals.json:twin_laws[].probability` are the per-roll rates derived from total natural prevalence numbers in the literature ("X% of natural specimens are twinned"). But:
- **The game rolls once per crystal at nucleation** (post-fix), so the realized in-game twin frequency is exactly the per-roll value.
- **Real-world prevalence partly reflects lifetime opportunity** for stress/thermal events to induce secondary twinning during growth, which the single-roll model doesn't capture.
- **Different minerals accumulate different growth-step counts** in typical scenarios — quartz might run 100 zones, a late-nucleating wulfenite gets 10 — so the multiplier between "per-roll rate" and "observed in-game prevalence" varies by mineral.

The four placeholders just populated (arsenopyrite 0.01, native_silver 0.05, argentite 0.04, chalcanthite 0.005) are research-grounded floors, not tuned for game-visible behavior. Likely too low for some minerals once the lifetime asymmetry is taken into account.

**What to build:**
1. Extend `tools/twin_rate_check.py` (or write a sibling tool) that runs each baseline scenario at seed 42, counts twinned vs untwinned crystals per mineral, and reports observed in-game frequencies. Compare to literature target ranges.
2. For each mineral that's "common-twinned in nature" but observed-rare in the sim (or vice versa), note the per-mineral average growth-step count and propose an adjusted per-roll probability that lands the observed rate within target.
3. Don't blanket-multiply — different minerals have different lifetime distributions, and some twins (Carlsbad, cyclic-sextet) are genuinely birth-time decisions where per-roll = lifetime rate.

**Out of scope for the retune itself:**
- Event-driven twins (thermal shock, tectonic event) — those remain in their grow_*() functions as event-conditional logic and aren't subject to this asymmetry. Currently quartz Dauphiné + the fortress-mode tectonic event.
- Habit-conditional twins (e.g., aragonite cyclic_sextet's "growth in twinned_cyclic habit" trigger) — these are nucleation-time decisions; the per-roll rate already matches the lifetime rate by construction.

**Relevant minerals to revisit during the retune** (from the commits' candid notes):
- cerussite cyclic_sixling at 0.4 — well-formed cerussite is nearly always cyclic-twinned in nature; per-roll 40% may underrepresent observed rate.
- sphalerite spinel-law at 0.015 — common in well-formed crystals; per-roll 1.5% looks low.
- calcite c-twin at 0.1 — common in many specimens; literature suggests 10-30% lifetime, may need bumping for short-lived calcite crystals.
- arsenopyrite trillings at 0.01 — "uncommon" but if observed-zero across baseline runs, likely needs bumping.
- chalcanthite cruciform at 0.005 — "rare" is consistent with the chalcanthite metastability mechanic (re-dissolves frequently), so observed-zero is geologically right; verify with the tool before bumping.

**Sequencing:** lands after the data-as-truth Option A refactor (initial fluid/T/P/wall → JSON5) so the retune can lean on stable declarative chemistry without conflating with infrastructure changes.

## 🧱 Data-as-truth Phase 2 — infrastructure follow-ups

Phase 1 (commit `2feb338`) and Phase 2 (commits `69f8acb..ce3dd5a`) migrated all 13 declarative scenarios + ~50 inline event closures to `data/scenarios.json5` + module-level handlers in `EVENT_REGISTRY`. The following items were noted in the Phase 2 handoff doc (`proposals/HANDOFF-DATA-AS-TRUTH-PHASE-2.md`) as out-of-scope for the migration itself but worth filing.

### `tools/sync-spec.js` Check 7 — cross-runtime EVENT_REGISTRY parity

**Why:** every event-type string in `data/scenarios.json5` must be registered in BOTH `vugg.py` and `index.html` `EVENT_REGISTRY`. Today the JSON5 loader validates each runtime against the spec at import/fetch time (loud failure if a referenced type is missing), but no cross-runtime check guarantees Python and JS register identical key sets. A missing/typo'd key on one side is caught only when that scenario is actually run in that runtime.

**What to build:** add Check 7 to `tools/sync-spec.js` — parse `EVENT_REGISTRY = {...}` literal from both `vugg.py` and `index.html` and assert identical key sets. Same idea as the existing mineral drift checks (Checks 1-6), just over the event-handler dimension.

**Effort:** small. The key-set extraction is regex-tractable (the registry is a contiguous dict literal in both files, with one key per line in the Phase 2 layout).

### `runSimulation` async-load guard (JS-only)

**Why:** JS loads `data/scenarios.json5` asynchronously via `_loadScenariosJSON5()`. After page reload, if the user clicks "Run" before the fetch completes, `SCENARIOS[scenarioName]` is undefined and `runSimulation` throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'temperature')`. Edge case in normal use (the fetch is fast on localhost), but reproducible on slow connections or first cold load. Phase 2 made every scenario JSON5-loaded, so this affects all 13 scenarios now, not just the original 4 from Phase 1.

**What to build:** in `runSimulation`, gate scenario execution on `_scenariosJson5Ready === true`. If not ready, show a "loading scenarios..." status message and either retry or block the click. Or — simpler — disable the Run button until ready and re-enable on fetch completion.

**Effort:** small.

### `scenario_random` JS-side parity gap

**Why:** Python has `scenario_random()` (in `vugg.py`); JS doesn't. JS exposes a "Random Vugg" button on the title screen that does its own thing (`index.html` ~line 16470). Pre-existing intentional drift, not introduced by Phase 2 — but now that all 13 declarative scenarios are unified through JSON5, `scenario_random` is the only remaining procedural divergence between the two runtimes. Worth either reconciling (port the Python scenario_random into JS so `SCENARIOS.random` works in both) or formally documenting the asymmetry in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Effort:** medium if porting. Python's `scenario_random` is ~200 lines of archetype dispatch + per-archetype fluid construction. The JS title-screen Random Vugg uses a different (simpler) generative model. Reconciling them = pick one, port to the other side.

**Sequencing:** none of these block. File and pick up when convenient.

## 📜 Narrative-extraction post-completion follow-ups

The 89/89 narrative-as-data extraction landed in commit `e731f1f` (2026-04-30). Two items were deferred during the extraction itself; both are now actionable:

### Drop inline JS fallbacks

**Why:** every JS dispatcher in `index.html` carries `narrative_blurb('species') || 'fallback prose...'` and `narrative_variant(...) || 'fallback prose...'` for each branch. These were defensive — if the async markdown fetch hadn't resolved by the time the narrator fired, the inline fallback prose would render instead. Now that all 89 species are in `_NARRATIVE_MANIFEST` and the fetch is awaited at startup, the fallbacks are useful only for `file://` boots before the fetch completes (rare).

**What to build:** decide policy with the boss — keep fallbacks as `file://` resilience, OR strip them all (~1500 lines saved across 89 narrators) and trust the loader. If stripping, do it as a single mechanical commit: `narrative_blurb('x') || '...'` → `narrative_blurb('x')` for every narrator. Tests + sync-spec confirm no regressions.

**Effort:** small if stripping (mechanical pattern). Zero if keeping.

**Where to find:** every `_narrate_<species>` method in `index.html` (search for `|| '`).

### Auto-generate `_NARRATIVE_MANIFEST` from `data/minerals.json`

**Why:** `_NARRATIVE_MANIFEST` is a hardcoded array of 89 species names in `index.html` (~line 3274). Adding a new mineral now requires both adding it to `data/minerals.json` AND remembering to append it to the manifest. Easy to forget. The pattern matches the rest of the data-as-truth arc: hardcode while small, automate when stable.

**What to build:** at module-load time, derive the manifest from `Object.keys(MINERAL_SPEC)` (the JS-side parse of `data/minerals.json`). Filter for species that have a `narratives/<species>.md` file (or skip the filter and let missing files return empty strings — already handled gracefully by the loader).

**Effort:** small. ~5 lines change. Consider whether the python-side wants a parallel cleanup (Python doesn't have a manifest — it loads on first call — so just JS).

**Where to find:** `index.html` `const _NARRATIVE_MANIFEST = [...]` declaration.

**Sequencing:** neither blocks. Both are quality-of-life cleanups for narrative-edit ergonomics.

---

## 🔬 Supersat drift follow-ups (post-v13 audit)

The v13 audit (`tools/supersat_drift_audit.py`, May 2026) found 11 mineral supersaturation formulas with structural drift between vugg.py and index.html. Two real physics bugs (galena + molybdenite missing O2 gates) and chalcopyrite's T-window were fixed in v13. The remaining 10 divergences are filed here — none are obvious bugs, but the drift means the browser sim and the Python sim give measurably different sigmas for the same fluid, which is its own problem.

### `effectiveTemperature` feature gap (Python lacks Mo-flux T modifier)

**Status:** structural drift, JS-only feature.
**Why:** index.html + agent-api/vugg-agent.js define `effectiveTemperature` on VugConditions — a Mo-flux modifier that widens the T window for porphyry sulfides (chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, molybdenite, quartz). Python's VugConditions has no such field; supersats use `self.temperature` directly. Net effect: a Mo-rich vug in JS shifts the chalcopyrite/galena/pyrite T sweet spots; in Python it doesn't.
**What to build:** decide whether effectiveTemperature is a real geochemical concept worth porting (Seo et al. 2012 documents Mo-flux thermal effects) or a JS-side decoration that should be removed. If porting: add `effective_temperature` property to VugConditions in vugg.py + thread through the 4-5 sulfide supersats. If removing: replace `this.effectiveTemperature` with `this.temperature` in JS. Either way, one runtime should be canonical and the other should match.
**Affected species:** chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, molybdenite (already aligned in v13 except for eT), quartz.
**Effort:** medium. ~4 hours of research + porting + test regen.

### `silica_equilibrium` field — JS quartz uses, Python doesn't

**Status:** structural drift.
**Why:** the audit shows JS quartz supersat references `this.silica_equilibrium` (a precomputed field?) while Python's `supersaturation_quartz` inlines `50.0 * math.exp(0.008 * T)`. Same formula presumably, but the JS version reuses a cached value. Verify whether the cache is updated correctly when temperature changes.
**Affected species:** quartz.
**Effort:** small. Read the JS cache update path; either inline it (match Python) or add a cache to Python. ~1 hour.

### Substantive formula divergence (5 species, design-choice review)

**Status:** structural drift, design-choice review needed.
**Why:** these 5 supersats have substantively different formulas between vugg.py and index.html — different hard gates, different scaling constants, different T windows, different pH logic. Each needs a focused read with the boss to decide which side is canonical.

| Species | Python | JS | Decision needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| feldspar | K-only (K<10/Al<3/SiO2<200), exp T decay below 300, pH<4 acid attack | K OR Na (`hasK \|\| hasNa`), 150-800 hard T window, 5.5-9 pH window, 250-500 sweet spot | Python keeps K and Na separate (supersaturation_albite); JS forks them in feldspar. Pick one design. |
| fluorite | 3-tier T (sweet 100-250 + ramp + decline), fluoro-complex penalty above F=80, pH<5 acid | 5-tier T (slow<50 + warming + sweet 100-250 + viable 250-350 + fade>350), pH<5 acid; NO fluoro-complex penalty | Each side has a feature the other lacks. Merge both? |
| selenite | not yet read; likely simpler | Ca>20+S>10+O2>0.3+T<80+pH 5-8, T<40 sweet ×1.5 | Read Python; choose richer formulation. |
| smithsonite | Zn<15+CO3<30+O2<0.3, T>100 decay (rate 0.02) | Zn<20+CO3<50+O2<0.2, T>200 hard fail, pH<5 hard fail, T>100 decay (rate 0.008), pH>7 ×1.2 | JS richer (pH window + alkaline boost + hard T cap). Port to Python. |
| wulfenite | constants 0.025/0.3/0.4/0.5/15.0/3.5/40.0/80/9.0 | constants 0.006/0.2/10/150/250/30.0/4/60.0/7 | Need full read of both; significant divergence in scaling. |

**Affected species:** feldspar, fluorite, selenite, smithsonite, wulfenite.
**Effort:** medium-large. Per-species reconciliation + baseline regen + test parity.

### `calcite` 500°C JS-inline thermal cap

**Status:** known-acceptable architectural divergence (not really a bug, documented for completeness).
**Why:** JS calcite has `if (this.temperature > 500) return 0;` inline. Python handles thermal decomposition via the top-level `THERMAL_DECOMPOSITION` table at line ~10639, which fires regardless of supersat returning >0. Same effective behavior, different mechanism. No action needed unless the dual mechanism causes confusion later.
**Effort:** zero (already aligned in effect).

### Sequencing

The `effectiveTemperature` gap is the most consequential — it touches 5 species and any new sulfide that arrives. Resolve that first before tackling the per-species divergences, since a Mo-flux decision affects how each one is reconciled.

## 🏷️ Internal token cleanup — finish the mode renames

**Status:** deferred. User-visible labels were renamed in commit `467e8c4` (and earlier — Fortress→Creative, Legends→Simulation, The Groove→Zen Mode/Record Player). Internal tokens (`fortress*`, `legends*`, `idle*`, `groove*`) still use the pre-rename names because renaming hundreds of CSS classes / DOM IDs / function names for no UX gain wasn't worth the churn.

**Token map** (canonical entry point → user-visible name):

| Internal token | User-visible | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fortressSim`, `#fortress-panel`, `.fortress-*`, `fortressBegin()`, `fortressStep()`, `fortressFinish()` | **Creative** | ~199 occurrences |
| `legendsSim`, `legendsSimSource` | **Simulation** | far fewer occurrences (~10s) |
| `idleSim`, `#idle-panel`, `.idle-*`, `idleTogglePlay()`, `idleAppendLog()`, `idleStep()`, `menuGo('idle')` | **Zen Mode** | ~40 occurrences |
| `grooveCollectionCrystals`, `playCollectedInGroove()`, `switchMode('groove')`, `#mode-groove`, `.groove-tooltip`, `.groove-canvas-wrap` | **Record Player** | ~30 occurrences. **Caveat:** the term "groove" is genuinely correct for the rainbow-lane visualization primitive inside the Record Player — that should keep the name even if the mode codepath is renamed. The boundary is the codepath/mode tokens vs. the visualization-routine tokens. |

**Discoverability breadcrumbs already in place** (so future devs greppin' a token find the rename context):
- Header comment block above each global declaration: `let fortressSim`, `let legendsSim`, `let idleSim`, `let grooveModalCrystal` (all in `index.html`)
- Section comments at `/* ---- Creative Mode Styles (internal: fortress-* IDs/classes — pre-rename token, kept) ---- */` and the matching `<!-- Creative Mode Panel -->` HTML comment
- Pre-rename source tokens scrubbed: `source: 'Fortress'` → `'Creative'`, `source: 'Legends'` → `'Simulation'`, `source: 'The Groove'` → `'Zen'`. The post-game info panel's "Source: ___ mode" line now matches the title-card labels.

**What the thorough cleanup looks like** (when someone wants to take it on):
1. Pick one mode at a time (start with `legendsSim` — fewest occurrences, lowest blast radius)
2. Rename the global, then the DOM IDs, then the CSS classes, then the function names — each as its own commit
3. Verify after each: pytest 1130/1130, sync-spec 0/89, browser smoke
4. The `groove → recordplayer` rename is the most carefully-scoped — keep `.groove-tooltip` and the rainbow-lane drawing routines named `groove*` (visualization primitive), only rename the mode-control surface

**Out of scope:** Python `vugg.py` doesn't have UI modes (it's the dev/test runtime); no rename needed there. agent-api/vugg-agent.js similarly headless.

The Creative mode setup panel currently exposes ~30 FluidChemistry sliders + temperature + pressure + new wall reactivity. These items extend the player's control over the rest of the wall + fluid surface.

### Wall porosity slider
**Status:** designed, ready to implement.
**Why:** porosity is geologically distinct from reactivity. Three coupled effects, each with its own engine hook:

| Effect | What it does | Hook |
|---|---|---|
| **(1) Surface area** | Multiplies wall dissolution rate (effective_rate × reactivity × porosity_multiplier) | `VugWall.dissolve()` rate calc |
| **(2) Matrix leaching** | Per-step ion influx from surrounding rock's wall_*_ppm reservoir into vug fluid, gated by porosity. Even at neutral pH, K/Ca/Si/Al migrate in. The Deccan zeolite mechanism — K/Ca/Si/Al arrive via porosity, not direct wall contact. | New per-step `leach_from_matrix()` method on `VugWall`, called alongside `dissolve()` |
| **(3) Residence time** | Controls fluid drainage / refresh. High porosity = fluid replaced often (dilute output). Low porosity = fluid sits, evaporates if exposed (concentrates → evaporites — the sabkha mechanic). | Modulates `flow_rate` and possibly an evaporation-concentration multiplier |

**Slider design sketch:**
- 0% (dense) — only vug-facing wall surface attacked. Default for Herkimer-style massive dolostone.
- 10% (typical limestone) — current implicit behavior baked into reactivity=1.0.
- 30% (chalky / oolitic) — ~3× effective surface area; faster dissolution + ion release.
- 50%+ (vuggy / cavernous) — fluid percolates through; might allow secondary nucleation IN wall pore space rather than only on the vug surface (interesting rendering question).

**Schema work needed for effect (2):** the `wall_*_ppm` fields only cover Fe/Mn/Mg today. Matrix leaching needs at minimum `wall_K_ppm`, `wall_Na_ppm`, `wall_Si_ppm`, `wall_Al_ppm` — and ideally per-composition profiles (limestone vs dolomite vs basalt vs granite vs phyllite each have different ion reservoirs). That naturally pushes toward the wall-composition-picker item below.

### Wall composition picker (Creative mode)
**Status:** queued behind reactivity slider.
**Why:** wall composition is currently hardcoded by FLUID_PRESET in `fortressBegin`. Player can't pick limestone vs dolomite vs silicate. With the reactivity slider live, exposing composition is the natural next wall control. Limestone / dolomite / silicate (with a sub-pick of pegmatite / granite / quartzite / phyllite / basalt) covers all the scenario use cases.

### Creative mode rework — full element-slider exposure
**Status:** flagged but not designed in detail.
**Why:** Creative mode setup exposes ~30 FluidChemistry elements as sliders, but some preset starter fluids contain trace chemistry the user can't see or modify until they're already in-game. Per the user's framing — starter fluids represent "what's in the rocks", so every element they define should be exposed at setup time. Bigger surgery than a single-slider add; needs a full UX pass on the setup panel layout.

## 🧪 Schema additions — new FluidChemistry fields + mineral engines

Each item below has the locality chemistry **pre-researched** during the chemistry audit. The work is engineering (add field + mineral engines + minerals.json entry + nucleation block) — no more literature pass needed.

### Cd field + grow_greenockite
**Status:** chemistry pre-researched, engine pending.
**Pre-researched value:** `Cd=2` for Tri-State (sphalerite carries Cd substituting for Zn — typically 1000-5000 ppm Cd in mineral, raw fluid Cd ~1-10 ppm). Greenockite (CdS) is the diagnostic yellow coating on Tri-State sphalerite.
**Source:** Schwartz 2000 (Econ. Geol. 95) on Cd in MVT sphalerite + Tri-State greenockite occurrence in Hagni 1976.
**Engineering needed:**
- `Cd: float = 0.0` field in FluidChemistry (Python @dataclass + JS class)
- `grow_greenockite` (CdS) implementation following the pattern of grow_native_gold (commit `e13d7f1`) — see that as template
- `supersaturation_greenockite` method
- Nucleation block in `check_nucleation` (substrate preference: on sphalerite)
- `MINERAL_GROW_FUNCS` dispatch entry
- `minerals.json` entry — yellow class_color, formula CdS, T tolerance similar to sphalerite
- Optionally: Cd-in-sphalerite trace tracking in `grow_sphalerite` (TitaniQ-analog)
- **Au audit pattern reminder:** when Cd lands, run the gap-check across all 10 anchored localities. Most will be `intentionally_zero`; Tsumeb / supergene scenarios may carry trace Cd (greenockite is reported there too).

**Minerals unlocked:** greenockite, hawleyite, Cd-trace in sphalerite.

### Au-Te coupling — grow_calaverite + grow_sylvanite (Bingham telluride cap)
**Status:** all upstream chemistry already in place; pure engine work.
**Why:** Bingham `scenario_porphyry` already has Au=2 + Te=2 + Ag=8 in init. Currently all the Au precipitates as native_gold; adding Au-Te competition would partition some Au into telluride growth instead. Bingham upper-level epithermal cap hosts these tellurides (Landtwing 2010 + Cook et al. 2009 Au-Ag-Te systematics).
**Engineering needed:**
- `supersaturation_calaverite` (AuTe2) and `supersaturation_sylvanite` ((Au,Ag)Te2) methods
- `grow_calaverite` and `grow_sylvanite` functions
- Nucleation blocks
- `MINERAL_GROW_FUNCS` dispatch entries
- `minerals.json` entries
- Update `grow_native_gold` to compete against tellurides when both Au and Te are present (currently Au always goes native)

**Minerals unlocked:** calaverite, sylvanite, krennerite (potentially).

### Auriferous-chalcocite trace tracking (Bisbee mode)
**Status:** schema mostly in place; modeling work needed.
**Why:** Bisbee's supergene Au literature (Graeme et al. 2019) emphasizes that much of the Au is hosted as a trace within chalcocite rather than as discrete native_gold crystals. Currently all Au in Bisbee precipitates as discrete native_gold instead of partitioning into chalcocite.
**Engineering needed:**
- Add Au-trace tracker on `grow_chalcocite` (parallel to how Mn/Fe traces are tracked in calcite — see `grow_calcite` for pattern)
- Add `trace_Au` field to GrowthZone if not already present
- Update narration / inventory output to surface auriferous-chalcocite vs pure-chalcocite distinction

**Effect:** Bisbee output would record both native gold pockets AND ppm-Au-bearing chalcocite zones — the latter being the more economically significant mode in real Bisbee.

### Ag/Ge mineral engines (Tsumeb downstream)
**Status:** Tsumeb fluid chemistry already populates Ag=8, Ge=5, Sb=5 (commit `684f035`). Mineral engines for the Ag-sulfosalts and Ge-sulfides don't exist yet — those are pure engine work.
**Engineering needed:**
- `grow_proustite` (Ag3AsS3) — ruby silver, As-end
- `grow_pyrargyrite` (Ag3SbS3) — ruby silver, Sb-end
- `grow_native_silver` (Ag) — analog of grow_native_gold
- `grow_chlorargyrite` (AgCl) — supergene Ag halide
- `grow_germanite` (Cu26Fe4Ge4S32) — Tsumeb type-locality Ge mineral
- `grow_renierite` ((Cu,Zn)11(Ge,As)2Fe4S16) — companion Ge mineral
- (Optionally) `grow_briartite` (Cu2(Fe,Zn)GeS4)
- Each needs supersaturation, growth, nucleation, dispatch, minerals.json entry
- **Au audit pattern reminder:** when each lands, run gap-check across all 10 anchored localities for Ag specifically (Bingham Ag=8 and Bisbee Ag=40 already populate; some MVT scenarios may need Ag promoted from "documented but no engine" to active).

## 📋 Audit-trail patterns established (reference, not work)

These aren't todos — they're conventions to follow when doing the work above:

- **`pending_schema_additions`** in `data/locality_chemistry.json` — for "value pre-researched, schema/engine not yet there". Includes value, unit, rationale, source, blockers, minerals_unlocked. See bingham_canyon entry as canonical example before Au shipped.
- **`intentionally_zero`** in `data/locality_chemistry.json` — for "we checked and zero is the right answer for this locality". Established in commit `e2048e9` for the Au audit. When any new schema field lands, run the per-locality gap-check and document zero values explicitly so future audits don't re-flag them.
- **Three-place note pattern** — when a new schema element is researched but engine pending, leave cross-referenced notes in: vugg.py scenario comment + index.html mirror comment + data/locality_chemistry.json `pending_schema_additions` block. See bingham_canyon Au notes (pre-commit `e13d7f1`) for the reference shape.
- **Push to Syntaxswine origin** — the user's fork is the push target; StonePhilosopher canonical is read-only here, boss promotes from Syntaxswine.

> **Layout flatten (2026-04-29, commit `4950ffa`):** the prior "per-commit docs/ mirror" pattern is retired. `web/` and `docs/` were collapsed into repo root; GitHub Pages now serves from root, no mirror needed. References to `web/index.html` or `docs/index.html` in completed-work briefs under `build/` are historical — current path is `index.html`.

## 🎯 SIM_VERSION
Currently **7** (bumped in commit `97cb088` for Round 7 Commit 3 — corundum family + marble_contact_metamorphism scenario added; previous commit `a2f8f94` was the 5→6 bump for Round 7 Commit 2, beryl family split).

Bump to 8 when:
- Cd field shipped (would shift Tri-State seed-42 output)
- Wall porosity slider shipped (changes existing scenario dissolution behavior at default settings)
- Au-Te coupling lands (would partition Bingham Au into telluride growth)
- Halide-expansion round (atacamite, halite, chlorargyrite, etc.)

Defer the version bump decision to whoever ships those changes.

History:
- v1: pre-audit defaults
- v2: scenario-chemistry audit (Apr 2026; commit `77d999a`)
- v3: arsenate/molybdate supergene cascade engines — arsenopyrite + scorodite + ferrimolybdite (Apr 2026; commits `1c9cd29` → `0cd182f`)
- v4: Round 5 sulfate expansion — barite + celestine + jarosite + alunite + brochantite + antlerite + anhydrite (Apr 2026; commits `ccb8ac6` → `a044e81`). Engine count 55 → 62. Coorong sabkha now produces the textbook gypsum + anhydrite + celestine + dolomite + aragonite assemblage. Brings the sulfate class from 1 mineral (selenite) to 8.
- v5: Round 5 gap-fill follow-ups (Apr 2026; commits `c8056ef` + `8b9c831`). Tri-State + Sweetwater O2 0.0→0.25 (mildly reducing MVT brine — barite + celestine activate); barite + celestine supersat O2 saturation retuned to /0.4 (saturates at SO₄/H₂S boundary). Tsumeb early ev_supergene_acidification 4-pulse event + Al 3→25 + jarosite/alunite per-check 0.45 — unlocks scorodite + jarosite + alunite + brochantite at Tsumeb. Engine count unchanged (62); chemistry tweaks only.
- v6: Round 7 Commit 2 — beryl family split (Apr 2026; commit `a2f8f94`). Split the inline-variety detector in `grow_beryl` into 5 first-class species: `beryl` (narrowed to goshenite/generic colorless), `emerald`, `aquamarine`, `morganite`, `heliodor`. Priority chain emerald > morganite > heliodor > aquamarine > goshenite baked into supersaturation gates via exclusion preconditions. `check_nucleation` uses one-per-step dispatch to prevent shared-Be-pool over-nucleation. Seed-42 `gem_pegmatite` now nucleates 4 emerald + 4 aquamarine + 3 morganite (goshenite naturally suppressed by chromophore priority). Engine count 62 → 66.
- v7: Round 7 Commits 3+4 — corundum family + marble_contact_metamorphism scenario (Apr 2026; commit `97cb088`). First **UPPER-BOUND gate** in the sim: SiO2 < 50 is the defining corundum constraint (with any more silica, Al + SiO2 drives to feldspar/kyanite/sillimanite). Shared `_corundum_base_sigma()` helper. Three new species: `corundum` (colorless/generic), `ruby` (Cr ≥ 2), `sapphire` (Fe ≥ 5 with in-engine color dispatch). New scenario anchored to Mogok Stone Tract (Al=50, SiO2=20, Ca=800, Cr=3, Fe=8, Ti=1, pH=8). Violet-sapphire (V-only path) deferred — would break necessity-of-Fe gate test. Engine count 66 → 69. Total baseline scenarios 12 → 13.

## 🧪 Scenario-tune follow-ups (deferred from v3 mineral expansion)

### ~~Tsumeb pH gap (now affects scorodite + jarosite + alunite)~~ ✅ **RESOLVED (v5, commit `8b9c831`)**
**Resolution:** Added `ev_supergene_acidification` event scheduled 4× (steps 5/8/12/16) in `scenario_supergene_oxidation` — drops pH to 4.0 + adds H₂SO₄ each pulse, holding the acid window against the limestone wall's carbonate buffering for ~15 steps before `ev_meteoric_flush` (step 20) neutralizes. Plus Tsumeb Al bumped 3→25 to clear alunite's Al/25 cap. Plus jarosite + alunite per-check probabilities bumped 0.18/0.15→0.45 to reflect their fast acid-sulfate kinetics in brief windows.

Now active at Tsumeb: scorodite (95% seed hit rate), jarosite (95%), alunite (70%), brochantite (already worked, now coexists). Antlerite correctly stays absent — Tsumeb is brochantite-dominant per geology, not antlerite-dominant (antlerite is the Atacama/Chuquicamata signature). See `data/locality_chemistry.json:tsumeb.mineral_realizations_v3_expansion.scorodite` + `mineral_realizations_v4_sulfate_expansion.jarosite/alunite/antlerite` for full citation tags.

### ~~Tri-State + Sweetwater O2=0.0 gap~~ ✅ **RESOLVED (v5, commit `c8056ef`)**
**Resolution:** Bumped Tri-State + Sweetwater O2 from default 0.0 to 0.25 — mildly reducing brine matching real MVT chemistry at the SO₄/H₂S boundary. Plus barite + celestine supersaturation O2 factor retuned from O2/1.0 to O2/0.4 (saturates at the SO₄/H₂S boundary, geochemically correct).

Verified seed-42:
- Tri-State (was 0/0): 6 active barite (max 32 µm), 10 celestine (max 111 µm)
- Sweetwater (was 0/0): 14 active barite (max 63 µm — Viburnum is the high-Ba MVT endmember per Stoffell 2008), 8 celestine (max 56 µm)

Coorong sabkha behavior unchanged (O2=1.5 was already saturated; engine retune is a no-op above O2=0.6).

### Bingham/Bisbee scorodite + ferrimolybdite end-to-end verification
**Status:** engines are wired and chemistry should produce both, but no full-scenario seed-42 run was executed during the v3 expansion (porphyry/Bisbee runtimes are slow). When time permits, run seed-42 porphyry (120 steps) and bisbee (340 steps) and confirm the realization predictions in `mineral_realizations_v3_expansion`:
- Bingham: arsenopyrite forms early, oxidizes after step 85, scorodite + ferrimolybdite nucleate post-oxidation
- Bisbee: arsenopyrite forms strongly (Fe=200 → enormous σ), oxidizes after step 65 ev_uplift_weathering, scorodite nucleates from arsenopyrite oxidation products

Failures would point to either (a) chemistry tuning needed (rare given the audit) or (b) σ thresholds need adjustment.

## 🔗 Canonical-only research / proposals (not yet folded into engine work)

These exist on `canonical/main` (StonePhilosopher) but were not merged into Syntaxswine fork during the recent rounds. Read and either implement, fold into BACKLOG, or merge:

- `proposals/MINERALS-RESEARCH-UNIMPLEMENTED.md` (canonical commit `41183b9`) — **DONE**: arsenopyrite/scorodite/ferrimolybdite engines shipped (commits `1c9cd29`–`0cd182f`). Expanded paragenetic notes on molybdenite + wulfenite from this file are reference-only (no engine changes needed).
- `proposals/MINERALS-RESEARCH-SULFATES.md` (Syntaxswine commit `ca6d710`, written this session) — **DONE**: all 7 sulfates (barite, celestine, jarosite, alunite, brochantite, antlerite, anhydrite) shipped (commits `ccb8ac6`–`a044e81`). The research doc remains the canonical citation source for narrators.
- `proposals/Gibbs-Thompson dissolution cycling — crystal quality mechanic` (canonical commit `6577442`) — **NOT YET READ**. Crystal-quality mechanic proposal. Action: read the file and decide whether to implement, scope into BACKLOG, or punt.

---

## 🔮 Round 6 candidates (not yet pre-researched)

Now that Round 5 sulfates are done, the next natural class expansion is **halides**. Candidates with chemistry already in FluidChemistry (Cl, Cu, Ag, Na, K all populated):

- **halite** (NaCl) — Coorong sabkha activation; salinity field already drives it
- **atacamite** (Cu₂Cl(OH)₃) — Cl-rich Cu oxide; Bisbee Cl=200 + Atacama; competes with brochantite (already flagged in `grow_brochantite`'s Cl>100 trace note)
- **chlorargyrite** (AgCl) — Tsumeb supergene Ag halide; activates the Ag pool that Tsumeb already populates
- **boleite** (KPb₂₆Ag₉Cu₂₄Cl₆₂(OH)₄₈ — extremely Cl-rich, deep blue; rare display target)

Plus possible follow-on Cu sulfates (chalcanthite — CuSO₄·5H₂O, the extreme-acid Cu sulfate that competes with antlerite below pH 1) and natrojarosite (Na variant of jarosite, common in salty AMD).

A research doc following the `MINERALS-RESEARCH-SULFATES.md` shape would be the next logical artifact.

## 💎 Round 7 — Gemstones ✅ SHIPPED (Apr 2026)

**Completed: beryl family + corundum family.** Per `proposals/MINERALS-PROPOSAL-GEMSTONES.md` + `proposals/MINERALS-RESEARCH-GEMSTONES.md`, 7 new first-class species (mineral count 62 → 69) landed across 4 commits:

- `a5fbaf6` — Commit 1: research compendium
- `a2f8f94` — Commit 2: beryl family split (SIM_VERSION 5→6)
- `97cb088` — Commits 3+4: corundum family + marble_contact_metamorphism scenario (SIM_VERSION 6→7)
- (this commit) — Commit 5: locality chemistry realizations + BACKLOG cleanup

Notable outcomes:
- **First upper-bound gate** in the sim: corundum family's SiO₂ < 50 constraint. This opens the door for the Al₂SiO₅ polymorph family (kyanite/andalusite/sillimanite) and other Si-undersaturated chemistry in future rounds.
- **Scaffolding tool proved out**: `tools/new-mineral.py` reliably inserted 7 JSON entries, generated paste-ready code stubs, and the auto-added entries passed all 48 parameterized per-mineral tests after engine code landed. ~15 minutes per species (down from ~45 min pre-tool).
- **Violet sapphire deferred**: V-only Tanzania variety would break the Fe-necessity gate test. Noted in Round 8+ candidates.
- **Mogok marble-contact scenario**: seed-42 nucleates 1 ruby + 1 calcite + 2 aragonite. Ruby wins the Cr=3 priority race; sapphire needs Cr depletion + Fe>=5 before it fires, which the 180-step window doesn't always afford. Further scenario tuning may be needed if we want seed-42 sapphire — consider ev_chromium_depletion event scheduled mid-run.

Deferred to a future round:
- Violet sapphire (V-only Tanzania) — separate `violet_sapphire` species with V-gate
- Color-change sapphire (Umba Valley, Cr+V+Fe) — could be a sub-variety of violet
- Alexandrite (BeAl₂O₄ + Cr) — chrysoberyl family; needs Be+Al+Cr with no Si (related to corundum SiO₂-undersaturation)
- Garnet supergroup (pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular, andradite, uvarovite) — clustered with D3
- Tanzanite (Ca₂Al₃Si₃O₁₂(OH) + V) — zoisite/epidote family
- Jade (jadeite = NaAlSi₂O₆ high-P + nephrite = Ca₂Mg₅Si₈O₂₂(OH)₂) — pressure-gated, clustered with D3
- Chrysoberyl (BeAl₂O₄) — related to corundum SiO₂-undersaturation; could be its own small cluster

## 🪨 Round 8 — Mineral expansion ✅ SHIPPED (Apr 2026)

**Completed: 15 new species across 5 sub-rounds.** Per the boss's 61-file research drop (canonical commit `f2939da`) + `proposals/ROUND-8-IMPLEMENTATION-KICKOFF.md`, mineral count 69 → 84, tests 842 → 1037 (+195), SIM_VERSION 7 → 8.

**Sub-rounds shipped:**
- 8a — silver suite (acanthite, argentite + 173°C paramorph mechanic, native_silver) — commits `3345bf1` → `aebeea6`
- 8b — native element trio (native_arsenic, native_sulfur synproportionation, native_tellurium) — commits `da76464` → `1b29ba0`
- 8c — Ni-Co sulfarsenide cascade (nickeline, millerite, cobaltite three-element gate + Bisbee Co=80/Ni=70) — commit `f050bb3`
- 8d — VTA suite (descloizite, mottramite, raspite, stolzite, olivenite + Tsumeb W=20) — commit `afc41e6`
- 8e — chalcanthite + water-solubility metastability mechanic — commit `a017844`

**Three new mineral-mechanic patterns added to the sim:**
1. **PARAMORPH_TRANSITIONS** (8a-2) — module-level dict + apply_paramorph_transitions hook in run_step. First non-destructive polymorph mechanic: argentite cooling past 173°C converts in-place to acanthite while preserving habit + dominant_forms + zones. Distinct from THERMAL_DECOMPOSITION (which destroys the crystal). 10 regression tests in `tests/test_paramorph_transitions.py`.
2. **Three-element gate** (8c-4) — cobaltite (CoAsS) requires Co + As + S all present simultaneously at minimum thresholds. First three-reagent gate; pattern available for future minerals (e.g., proustite Ag₃AsS₃, pyrargyrite Ag₃SbS₃).
3. **Water-solubility metastability** (8e) — chalcanthite re-dissolves when fluid.salinity<4 OR fluid.pH>5. Per-step hook in run_step distinct from THERMAL_DECOMPOSITION + PARAMORPH_TRANSITIONS — this is just chemistry. 5 regression tests in `tests/test_metastability.py`.

**Five new chemistry-dispatch patterns:**
1. **Depletion / overflow gate** (8a-3, 8b) — native_silver (S<2), native_arsenic (S+Fe<thresholds), native_tellurium (Au+Ag<thresholds). Inverse of normal supersaturation logic.
2. **Synproportionation Eh window** (8b-2) — native_sulfur fires only in the H₂S/SO₄²⁻ boundary (0.1<O2<0.7). First Eh-window engine.
3. **Mutual-exclusion priority gate** (8c-3) — millerite (NiS) returns 0 when As>30 + T>200 (nickeline NiAs takes priority).
4. **Cu/Zn-ratio fork** (8d) — descloizite/mottramite + olivenite/adamite both use Cu>Zn vs Zn≥Cu dispatchers.
5. **Kinetic-preference dispatcher** (8d-2) — raspite/stolzite both PbWO₄, kinetic preference favors stolzite ~90% of rolls.

**Backlog items unblocked or ready:**
- **Au-Te coupling round** (calaverite + sylvanite + hessite + altaite + tetradymite + coloradoite) — natural Round 9 lift. Te is now plumbed in FluidChemistry; native_tellurium's Au>1 gate becomes the dispatcher's Au-rich path → calaverite. Hg field needed for coloradoite (HgTe). Once Au is consumed by calaverite, residual Te will fire as native_tellurium.
- **Tarnish clock for native silver/arsenic/tellurium** (deferred from 8a + 8b) — per-step acanthite/arsenolite/tellurite-rind accumulation regardless of S availability. Should also apply to existing native_bismuth.
- **Cobalt-Ontario / Freiberg silver vein scenario** — would activate the primary nickeline + cobaltite + native_silver suite at seed-42 (currently absent; Bisbee chemistry isn't As-rich enough for sulfarsenide formation).
- **Acid mine drainage scenario** — would activate chalcanthite at seed-42 (currently absent_at_seed_42 in declared scenarios).

**Outstanding work from the boss's research drop (NOT in Round 8):**
- 41 expanded-research narrator refresh sweep — the boss's 61-file commit included richer research for 41 already-shipped species. Folding the new detail into existing narrators is a multi-session task; lower priority than next-round species expansion.

## 💎💎 Round ~end-of-list (positions ~185-200) — Diamond + mantle/high-P plumbing cluster

**RESERVED SLOTS**: diamond is the last mineral on the target list of 200, and ~15-20 slots adjacent to it are reserved for minerals that share the same plumbing investment (the "D3 option" from `proposals/MINERALS-PROPOSAL-GEMSTONES.md`). Rationale: the infrastructure to model diamond (carbon field in FluidChemistry + pressure-as-chemistry-driver + mantle T+P regime) is heavy; single-use for diamond would be wasteful. Clustering lets the plumbing pay for itself ~15-20 times.

**Reserved cluster (tentative order, all share the D3 plumbing):**

### Class 1 — carbon-field additions (C added to FluidChemistry)
- **graphite** (C) — metamorphic schists; a legitimate vug mineral (unlike diamond)
- **moissanite** (SiC) — rare, mostly meteoritic; scientific novelty
- **anthraxolite** (solid hydrocarbon) — already partially implemented via Herkimer narrative; could be a real inclusion mineral

### Class 2 — pressure-gated polymorphs (making `VugConditions.pressure` a real supersaturation driver instead of cosmetic)
- **kyanite** (Al₂SiO₅, high-P) — blue-blade gem
- **andalusite** (Al₂SiO₅, low-P) — chiastolite cross-pattern gem
- **sillimanite** (Al₂SiO₅, high-T) — completes the classic Al₂SiO₅ phase-diagram triangle
- **coesite** (SiO₂ high-P polymorph) — meteor-crater + UHP subduction indicator
- **stishovite** (SiO₂ extreme-P polymorph) — shock metamorphism
- **jadeite** (NaAlSi₂O₆) — jade; low-T high-P subduction
- **omphacite** (eclogite pyroxene) — deep subduction
- **lawsonite** (CaAl₂Si₂O₇(OH)₂·H₂O) — blueschist facies indicator
- **glaucophane** (Na₂(Mg,Fe)₃Al₂Si₈O₂₂(OH)₂) — the amphibole that names blueschist

### Class 3 — mantle / kimberlite xenolith minerals (needs mantle T+P + the above plumbing)
- **olivine / peridot** (Mg₂SiO₄) — the most abundant mineral on Earth by volume; its absence is the biggest gap in the current sim; gem variety is peridot
- **enstatite** (MgSiO₃) — mantle orthopyroxene
- **diopside / chrome diopside** (CaMgSi₂O₆) — mantle clinopyroxene; bright-green gem
- **pyrope garnet** (Mg₃Al₂Si₃O₁₂) — blood-red gem; Bohemian garnet
- **spinel** (MgAl₂O₄) — gem (Black Prince's "Ruby" in the Crown Jewels is actually a spinel); uses corundum's SiO₂-undersaturated gate
- **phlogopite** (KMg₃AlSi₃O₁₀(F,OH)₂) — bronze-brown mica xenocryst
- **ilmenite** (FeTiO₃) — kimberlite prospecting indicator
- **chromite** (FeCr₂O₄) — source of the Cr that gives emerald its color; black octahedra
- **perovskite** (CaTiO₃) — mantle; eponymous to the perovskite structure family
- **diamond** (C) — the capstone

### New scenarios enabled by Class 2 + 3 plumbing
- `scenario_blueschist_subduction` — lawsonite, glaucophane, jadeite, omphacite
- `scenario_impact_crater` — coesite, stishovite, shocked quartz, meteoritic moissanite
- `scenario_kimberlite` — diamond + pyrope + chrome diopside + olivine + phlogopite + ilmenite + chromite xenocryst suite

### Interim placeholder plan
Until the D3 plumbing round arrives (late in the 200-mineral runway), diamond stays on hold. If the user wants a visible diamond before the plumbing round, Option D2 (xenocryst event in a lightweight kimberlite scenario) can ship as a bridge — 2-4 hours; `scenario_kimberlite` created as a shell, diamond teleports in as a pre-formed crystal, narrator explains the xenocryst origin honestly. When the D3 plumbing lands, diamond gets retrofitted to mantle-grown-in-sim and the shell scenario fills out with the rest of the cluster.

## 🌐 3D simulation — loose ends from the multi-ring rollout (May 2026)

**Context:** the 3D-track session that landed Phases A → D v1 + canvas fix + sphere shape + cross-axis polar + per-latitude twist (commits `03625b0` through `1c77950`, ten commits) left a few intentional gaps. Listing them here so they don't fall through. Tutorial 3 (the "Fourth Door" oxidation breach) is also deferred, but is tracked separately in the tutorial proposal docs.

### Sim-version 20 mineral drop — bornite + magnetite

**Status:** known regression from Phase C v1, accepted at the time, expects_species lists updated with a comment pointing back here.

**Why:** Phase C v1 (commit `375adcf`) wired growth to per-ring chemistry. Each crystal's growth now reads `ring_fluids[crystal.wall_ring_index]` instead of the global, with mass-balance consumption hitting that ring's fluid. Inter-ring diffusion homogenizes slowly, so per-ring chemistry diverges briefly from the bulk during fast nucleation bursts. At seed 42 this shifted two borderline minerals out of the "fires reliably" window:
- `bornite` in `porphyry`
- `magnetite` in `deccan_zeolite`

Their engines and chemistry data are unchanged. Their gates just don't get crossed at seed 42 under sim_version 20+. The expects_species lists in `data/scenarios.json5` were trimmed (with comments referencing this entry) so the tests pass.

**What to build:**
1. Pick a chemistry-tuning approach for these two scenarios. Options:
   - Tune the scenario's initial fluid so the engine's σ for the dropped mineral is comfortably above its nucleation threshold by step ~50, even with per-ring fragmentation
   - Add a small event nudge mid-scenario (e.g. `magnetite_seed_pulse` at step 60 in deccan_zeolite) to push σ over the gate at the right moment
   - Bias `_assign_wall_ring` so minerals with strong scenario-anchor expectations land on the equator ring (which shares storage with conditions.fluid via aliasing — stronger event coupling)
2. Restore the dropped expects_species entries when the tuning lands.

**Out of scope:** changing the per-ring fluid mechanic itself. The fragmentation is the design intent.

### Habit textures missing in 3D mode — RESOLVED by wireframe crystals

**Status:** **superseded** by `proposals/PROPOSAL-WIREFRAME-CRYSTALS.md`. Wireframe rendering replaces wedge+habit-texture entirely in 3D mode — each habit now resolves to a hand-crafted polyhedron primitive (cube, hex_prism_terminated, scalenohedron, …), painted as silhouette fill + wireframe edges. Habit fidelity in 3D is now structural (the geometry IS the habit) instead of textural.

The original `drawHabitTexture` 2D textures (`_texture_sawtooth`, `_texture_rhomb`, etc.) stay in the codebase for the 2D topo strip — that path is untouched.

**If 2D-mode wireframes are ever wanted** (top-down orthographic of one slice), the same primitive library projects orthographically just as well; would respect the slice stepper state. Out of scope for v0.

### Hit-test broken in 3D mode — RESOLVED

**Status:** **resolved** in commit `f77a757`.

The original plan (cast a ray, intersect with the sphere shell, recover phi/theta) didn't survive contact with the actual cavity geometry: rings have latitude-dependent radius factors (`sin(φ)·polar_profile`) and per-cell base_radius wobble, so a ray-vs-mean-sphere intersection lands beyond where the cells actually sit. Switched to brute-force nearest-projected-cell — forward-project every cell's anchor center and pick the one whose projection is closest to the cursor in screen space. Naturally correct for the bumpy surface and handles both front and back hemispheres without explicit hemisphere math. ~2k operations per hit-test, negligible at hover-event frequency.

User-intent rule: prefer crystal-bearing cells over bare-wall ones within 14 px of the cursor (the user almost certainly meant the visible crystal, not its bare neighbor). Bare-wall tooltip itself is suppressed in 3D mode — the wireframe topo map shows the wall directly, so the readout was friction without information.

Same change refactored `_topoTooltipFromEvent` to consume `_topoHitTest`'s cell directly instead of duplicating the geometry math (the duplication was 2D-only and wouldn't have worked in 3D anyway).

### Water-level mechanic — partial-fill vugs (foundation)

**Status:** **foundation shipped 2026-05-04** (SIM_VERSION 23 → 24). Companion: `PROPOSAL-EVAPORITE-WATER-LEVELS.md`. Bridges directly into `PROPOSAL-AIR-MODE.md`'s air-mode end-to-end.

What landed:
- `VugConditions.fluid_surface_ring: float | None` — the meniscus position along the polar axis. None = fully submerged (legacy default; existing scenarios stay byte-identical).
- `VugConditions.ring_water_state(ring_idx, ring_count) -> 'submerged' | 'meniscus' | 'vadose'` classifier on both Python and JS sides.
- Nucleation reads the ring's water state and stamps `Crystal.growth_environment` accordingly (`vadose → 'air'`, otherwise `'fluid'`). The dormant air-mode plumbing from v22 now has a real trigger.
- 3D renderer paints a translucent blue meniscus disc at the surface latitude, sorted into the painter's order so it occludes correctly with rings/crystals.
- Tests: `tests/test_water_levels.py` covers default-submerged, partial-fill, integer-boundary, fully-drained, fully-flooded, single-ring, and the air/fluid stamping invariant. Baseline `seed42_v24.json` is byte-identical to v23 (legacy default keeps behavior stable).

What's NOT in the foundation (deferred to follow-on stages, in order of likely-next):
1. **Renderer tier-2 polish:** disc Z-occlusion is done at disc-centre granularity; objects straddling the disc's z get a coarse painter's-order tie. Per-segment splitting if it reads wrong at extreme tilts.
2. **~~Scenario events that mutate `fluid_surface_ring`~~** — **shipped 2026-05-04** (SIM_VERSION 24 → 25). `event_supergene_dry_spell` now drops the surface to mid-cavity (ring 8) and `event_bisbee_final_drying` fully drains (ring 0). Engine helper `_apply_vadose_oxidation_override` runs at the top of every `run_step` after events have applied: rings that just transitioned wet → vadose get O2 ratcheted to 1.8 (oxidizing) and S × 0.3 (sulfide oxidation depletes solute sulfur). Submerged rings keep the scenario's chemistry, so the floor stays reducing while the ceiling oxidizes — matching real supergene paragenesis. Existing oxidation-product engines (limonite, cerussite, malachite, autunite, scorodite, …) fire naturally because they already read each crystal's ring fluid via Phase C v1 plumbing. Verified in browser preview: post-drainage bisbee has 12 air-stamped supergene crystals (lepidocrocite, chrysocolla, hematite, annabergite, erythrite, quartz). Baseline `seed42_v25.json` regenerated; full suite 1376/1376 green.

   **Follow-up shipped 2026-05-04** (SIM_VERSION 25 → 26): host-rock porosity. New `VugConditions.porosity: float` (default 0.0 = sealed cavity, no drainage). Per-step continuous drift: `fluid_surface_ring -= porosity × WATER_LEVEL_DRAIN_RATE` (currently 0.05 rings/step at porosity=1.0 — drains 16 rings in 320 steps, matching typical scenario length). Asymmetric on purpose — porosity is a pure sink, refilling stays event-driven. Two example events for sudden fill/drain: `event_tectonic_uplift_drains` (snaps to 0) and `event_aquifer_recharge_floods` (snaps to ceiling via a 1e6 sentinel that the drift method clamps to ring_count). Default `porosity=0.0` keeps existing scenarios sealed and byte-identical to v25. Full suite 1386/1386 green.

   **Open polish — scaled / depth-proportional drainage:** the v26 drift uses a constant rate. A more physically-faithful model is RC-circuit-like: drainage proportional to depth above some equilibrium (the regional water table the cavity is sitting in). High when the cavity is full, slowing as it empties. The constant-rate model is simpler to reason about and reads correctly for most scenarios; the proportional model better captures cavities that sit near the regional water table and re-equilibrate to a non-zero level. Pick up if a scenario's drainage curve doesn't read right.
3. **~~Air-mode habit consequences~~** — **shipped 2026-05-04** (commit `4f71bbc`). `PRIM_DRIPSTONE` is now in the wireframe library; `_lookupCrystalPrimitive` overrides eligible habits (prismatic, acicular, rhombohedral, scalenohedral, botryoidal, plus their compound variants) to dripstone when `Crystal.growth_environment === 'air'`. Cubic / octahedral / tetrahedral / tabular / dipyramidal / pyritohedral habits stay canonical (galena cubes don't form icicles). The renderer's existing c-axis flip handles ceiling-vs-floor orientation: ceiling cells get c-axis world-down (stalactite hanging), floor cells get c-axis world-up (stalagmite standing). Reuses one primitive for both via the orientation logic, per PROPOSAL-AIR-MODE.md Stage A.
4. **~~Evaporite-specific minerals + concentration multiplier~~** — **shipped 2026-05-04** (SIM_VERSION 26 → 27). New per-ring `FluidChemistry.concentration` multiplier (default 1.0 — byte-identical legacy behavior) boosted by 3× at every wet → vadose transition; models the geological reality that water leaving a ring concentrates the remaining solutes. New `WATER_STATE_PREFERENCE` table biases evaporite minerals (selenite ×2.5, anhydrite ×2, halite ×4) toward the meniscus ring — bathtub-ring chemistry. Halite added (NaCl, cubic + hopper-growth habit, supersaturation reads Na × Cl × concentration² so it stays dormant in scenarios that don't drain). Bisbee post-drain and sabkha cycling now grow halite naturally; mvt / reactive_wall / porphyry don't (gates correctly tuned to require evaporative drainage). Full suite 1562/1562 green.

   **Borax + dehydration paramorph follow-up shipped 2026-05-04** (SIM_VERSION 27 → 28). Adds borax (Na₂[B₄O₅(OH)₄]·8H₂O) — alkaline-brine borate evaporite with Na + B + pH ≥ 7 + T ≤ 60°C + `concentration ≥ 1.5` hard gate (active-evaporation only; submerged rings can't nucleate). Three habits per the research file: prismatic (Boron CA museum specimens), cottonball (Death Valley playa surface), massive (tincal nodules). New DEHYDRATION_TRANSITIONS framework — environment-triggered paramorph (counterpart to PARAMORPH_TRANSITIONS' temperature trigger). Borax in a vadose ring accumulates `Crystal.dry_exposure_steps`; once ≥ 25 steps, it pseudomorphs to tincalconite (Na₂B₄O₇·5H₂O) with external shape preserved. Heat path fires immediate dehydration above 75°C. Tincalconite is a paramorph-only product — has supersat=0 stub + no-op grow function so it satisfies the spec coverage tests but never nucleates from solution. The signature "borax effloresces in your collection drawer" mechanic, geologically authentic. Concentration is also now excluded from inter-ring diffusion (it's per-ring evaporation-history state, not a diffusable solute) — small drift in bisbee halite max-size as a result. 16 new tests; full suite 1595/1595 green.
   **Naica + Searles Lake locality scenarios shipped 2026-05-04** (SIM_VERSION 29 → 30). Two new geologically-anchored scenarios that actually exercise the v27-29 evaporite suite end-to-end. **Naica geothermal** (Cueva de los Cristales, Chihuahua, Mexico) per Garcia-Ruiz et al. 2007 *Geology* 35:327 — initial 56°C anhydrite-saturated water cools through six slow_cooling pulses to ~52°C, growing 10 selenite cathedral blades; 1985 mining drainage event drops the cave; 2017 recharge event refloods. **Searles Lake** (San Bernardino Co, CA) per Smith 1979 USGS PP 1043 — Mojave alkaline-saline brine with five wet/dry seasonal cycles. Winter freezes (T=8°C, surface drops to ring 4 from cold-air sublimation) → mirabilite + halite + borax fire. Summer bakes (T=55°C, surface drops to 0 = full drain) → mirabilite paramorphs to thenardite, borax to tincalconite, halite continues. Sierra snowmelt fresh_pulse events refill the basin between cycles. Six new event types registered in EVENT_REGISTRY (naica_slow_cooling, naica_mining_drainage, naica_mining_recharge, searles_winter_freeze, searles_summer_bake, searles_fresh_pulse). Cleanup: removed concentration decrement from evaporite engines — concentration is an evaporation-history multiplier, not a solute mass account, so precipitating solutes shouldn't undo it. Drift: bisbee halite max-um shifts slightly from this fix; baseline regenerated. Full suite 1631/1631 green.

   **Mirabilite + thenardite triplet completion shipped 2026-05-04** (SIM_VERSION 28 → 29). Closes the Na-sulfate evaporite pair using the v28 dehydration framework. Mirabilite (Na₂SO₄·10H₂O, Glauber salt) is the cold-side decahydrate stable below the 32.4°C eutectic; thenardite (Na₂SO₄, anhydrous) is the warm-side product. Both gate on Na + S + concentration ≥ 1.5; mirabilite refuses to nucleate above 32°C and thenardite refuses below 25°C, with a small eutectic window between where neither fires (real geology has metastability there). Mirabilite → thenardite added to DEHYDRATION_TRANSITIONS with T_max=32.4 — heat path fires the moment a warming brine crosses the line; slow vadose-exposure path (30 dry steps) covers cold dry caves where Glauber salt loses water without warming. Three-mineral evaporite paramorph triplet now: borax → tincalconite (humidity), mirabilite → thenardite (mostly heat), and the older argentite → acanthite (T-falling) for the cool-side polymorph case. Engine drift: zero — no scenarios seed Na+S+cool-T+concentration simultaneously, so mirabilite/thenardite stay dormant in the v28 baseline. 11 new tests; full suite 1622/1622 green.

6. **Dripstone aspect-ratio refinement:** primitive radius taper (0.30 → 0 across 4 latitude rings) yields ~5-10:1 once multiplied by typical prismatic crystal ratios. Photographs of mature cave stalactites show even slimmer (10-20:1) — bias future dripstone crystals' a_width_mm via a per-habit override if it reads too stubby in scenarios. Soda-straw variant for very young dripstone (hollow tube the diameter of a water drop) is a separate primitive worth adding when a scenario actually grows dripstone from t=0.

### Phase D v2 — mineral-spec orientation hints

**Status:** **shipped 2026-05-04**. See companion `PROPOSAL-AIR-MODE.md` for the air-mode-specific extension (a separate future task).

Geological background corrected: in a fully fluid-filled vug at depth, gravity-driven settling is weak and most minerals are spatially neutral. Documented preferences trace to density-driven convection, gravity-assisted micro-cluster settling before nucleation, or substrate-chemistry effects — NOT direct gravity on growing crystals. (The original BACKLOG framing of "calcite scalenohedra hang from the ceiling under gravity" was the cave-mode story; in fluid-filled vugs the bias is much subtler.)

Implementation: per-mineral `ORIENTATION_PREFERENCE` table in `vugg.py` with strong/weak factors (3.0× / 1.5×), consumed by `_assign_wall_ring` to bias the area-weighted sampling. Spatially neutral minerals (most species) stay area-weighted as before.

Documented preferences applied:
- **Floor (subtle):** galena, malachite, azurite, barite, celestine, goethite, native_gold, native_silver, smithsonite — density-driven micro-cluster settling or supergene fluid pooling
- **Floor (strong):** selenite (gypsum) — Naica-style subaqueous pool growth
- **Ceiling (subtle):** hematite (specular rosette / "iron rose")
- **Wall:** stibnite, bismuthinite — acicular sprays grow perpendicular to substrate
