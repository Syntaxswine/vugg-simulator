# HANDOFF — Geological Movements project + carried backlog (2026-06-01)

**What this is:** the single master document for the active **Geological
Movements** project AND a distilled, current snapshot of the whole open
backlog. Part I = the project we're building now. Part II = everything else
we want to do, carried forward. The next builder can act from this doc alone.

**Tip state:** `origin/main` (Syntaxswine) current; **SIM_VERSION 167**; full
suite green; working tree clean. Canonical (`StonePhilosopher`) minerals.json
FIXED 2026-06-01 (`083d994`, boss).

## ★ North Star — follow the science (boss, 2026-06-01)

The North Star of the whole project is **follow the science**: at every step,
model what real rocks actually do. The **finish line** — a *replication of life
with backward compatibility* (show a photo of a real crystal, get back the
seeds + settings that regrow it — the inverse of crystal-cipher) — is NOT a
target you aim at directly. It is the **inevitable consequence** of following
the science faithfully:

- You can't aim at "replicate all of life" — too big, unknowable. You CAN
  answer, at every step, "is this what real rocks do?" Faithful local steps
  compose into a faithful whole.
- **Invertibility is inherited, not engineered.** Nature's processes are
  deterministic functions of their conditions — a zoned crystal IS the record
  of its fluid history. A model that mirrors the physics inherits its
  invertibility from reality; we only have to not break it (hence seed-linking,
  deterministic streams, no wall-clock).
- The inevitability holds **only if every step is science-true.** One fabricated
  citation or unchecked "good enough" mechanism snaps the guarantee — it inserts
  a step that doesn't compose toward the real thing. So the discipline (verify
  sources, defer to geology, observe before assert, never fabricate) isn't
  caution for its own sake — it's what keeps the destination reachable.

### What "byte-identical / replication of life" actually means (boss, 2026-06-02)
Do NOT under-shoot this (I did, twice — first missing inversion, then missing
individuality). Byte-identical means the **INDIVIDUAL crystal, not a plausible
member of its type.** Growing "a doubly-terminated 1.5″ calcite on 2″ sphalerite"
that matches species + habit + size is a **type-match** and is NOT the target —
it misses *"all the textures and oddities that make that crystal THAT crystal"*:
step-bunching, etch pits, phantoms, twin re-entrants, included blebs, the
asymmetry from the side that faced the fluid. None of that is habit; **all of it
is record** — the deterministic consequence of that individual's contingent
history.
- **The textures are not decoration to add — they EMERGE from complete physics
  run on the exact conditions.** The crystal *computed* its texture by living its
  history; a complete-enough sim re-runs that computation. So a small seed CAN
  reproduce a megabit crystal: the seed is small, the **physics** is what's big
  and does the unfolding (like a short PRNG seed → long reproducible stream).
- **Byte-identical is the ASYMPTOTE of forward-fidelity at resolution, not a
  bolt-on feature.** Every increment of truer + FINER physics emits more of the
  real textures on its own. This is *why* the finish line is inevitable iff we
  follow the science — all the way down into the grain.
- **Honest distance:** today the forward model emits STYLIZED crystals
  (primitives + habit tokens), not etch pits / step-bunching / phantoms at
  individual resolution. So the texture layer isn't even in the forward physics
  yet, let alone invertible. Bulk-chemistry fidelity (Eh, movements) is the
  COARSEST grain — real, necessary, but the individual lives many resolution
  increments up. Don't offer type-match seed-searches as progress toward an
  individual; they're a category answer to a token question.

Every arc — Movements included — needs no other justification than: *it is the
next faithful step.* Movements aren't chrome; they're "model what real broths
actually do."

# PART I — THE GEOLOGICAL MOVEMENTS PROJECT (active)

## The problem (measured, not assumed)
`tools/broth-stability-probe.mjs` (2026-06-01): **~64% of broth fields are a
dead-flat line** over a vug's life (cooling 76%, sabkha 70%, bisbee 66%, mvt
65%, porphyry 64%, supergene 44%). **`Eh` (redox) is frozen at 200 in every
scenario** — the master control on Fe/Mn/Cu/U/As/V, nailed down. Where elements
move at all, it's because a discrete event shoved them. The broth is a **step
function**; real vug chemistry is a **continuously evolving curve**.

## The science (settled — see the docs)
- `RESEARCH-vug-fluid-evolution-2026-06-01.md` — deep-research pass, 23
  verified findings, research-grade citations (NOT yet project-canonical —
  open-the-source before any land in code/data, per the v145 rule).
- **Confirmed:** master variables (T, pH, redox) drive chemistry; elements
  **covary** off shared drivers, not independently (boiling co-precipitates
  Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn — Drummond & Ohmoto 1985). Unfreezing **redox** is the #1 fix.
- **Correction 1 (red noise):** measured natural zoning is **anti-persistent /
  mean-reverting** at fine scale (Holten 1997), NOT a persistent random walk.
  Model = **moving setpoint + mean-reverting (OU) texture**. Hasselmann-1976
  red-noise transfer to geochemistry is unsupported (my analogy, flagged).
- **Correction 2 (iron):** hydrothermal Fe is dominantly ferrous, transported
  as Cl complexes → banding is **solubility cycling** (pH/salinity/buffer), NOT
  in-fluid Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ oxidation. The oxidation story is the **supergene** regime.
- Self-organized intrinsic zoning is real (Barker & Cox 2011) → a separate,
  lower-priority lane for fine texture; coarse stage-banding is what we model.

## The design (agreed — see PROPOSAL-EVENTS-AS-GEOLOGICAL-MOVEMENTS.md §8/§9/§9b)
- **Primitive alphabet, not a menu.** Master-variable trajectories = sums of
  composable operators: **TREND / PULSE (trains) / STEP / OSCILLATION
  (mean-reverting) / MIXING.** Named archetypes (orogenic, hydrothermal pulse
  train, meteoric front, magmatic-hydrothermal) are just **presets**; the seed
  samples the *continuous* space, so most vugs are unnamed blends. "Just because
  a pattern hasn't been named doesn't mean it doesn't happen."
- **Elements are NOT randomized.** Move the master variables; let the existing
  saturation/SI engines translate that into *correlated* element pulses. The
  seed gives reproducibility; the SI engines give geological coherence; so the
  shapes are free to vary without going incoherent.
- **Seeded movements from a dedicated sub-stream off the VUGG seed.**
  `makeRng(hash(vuggSeed,"movements"))`, deterministic FNV-1a (no
  Math.random/Date.now — resume-safe). Boss's call: link to the *vugg* seed
  (not a separate chemistry seed) so the vug's geology drives its chemical
  outcome — one coherent story per seed, maximal per-seed variety. Dedicated
  stream (not shared `rng`) so movement-tuning doesn't displace nucleation order.
  Reproducibility is **required**: baseline tests depend on it AND the
  crystal-cipher sub-project (Part II-B) needs bit-exact regeneration.
- **Opt-in rollout.** Movements fire only for scenarios that opt in;
  un-migrated scenarios stay byte-identical (draw-gate like the v162 thermal-
  pulse `&&` trick). Pilot one, look + listen, then migrate incrementally.
- **Mechanical sub-events stay instantaneous** (a brecciation rupture); the
  *regime* around them is the movement.

## Build plan (phased)
- **✅ Phase 0 — dark scaffold (DONE — `e87bf9d` + `91e18b4`).** Movement PRNG +
  primitive operators + OU texture + no-op-safe applicator + the SPATIAL-origin
  data model (`origin` field + seeded `_pickOriginCell`), all **default-off →
  proven sim-neutral** (seed-42 + strip-digest byte-identical, 1712/1712, NO
  SIM_VERSION bump). The engine exists; nothing opts in yet.
- **Phase 1 — meteoric-front temporal pilot.** Opt ONE supergene scenario in
  (bisbee/supergene_oxidation/schneeberg). Redox-led (exercises the frozen-Eh
  fix), the regime where our iron model is unambiguous (oxidation), most
  existing scenarios to validate against. Regen that one baseline (SIM bump),
  look at the strip + listen, decide ramp-vs-drift / texture by eye + ear.
  (Open decision: scenario + ramp-vs-drift.)
- **Phase 2 — fluid-source spots (spatial).** See PROPOSAL §10. Cracks/geysers/
  hot spots: seeded (off the cavity seed) wall points that (a) anchor
  `origin:'cell'` movements, (b) bias local nucleation/deposition, (c) add a
  local wall-decay bonus, (d) open/close via events (spatializing the existing
  seal/breach handlers). Sub-steps 2a seed+observe (dark) → 2b wall-decay bonus
  → 2c origin-rides-spots + deposition bias → 2d open/close events; each its own
  baseline regen + look. This is the physical body of §9c and feeds per-vertex.
- **Phase 3 — incremental rollout.** Migrate further scenarios/archetypes one
  at a time, each its own dense commit + baseline regen.
- **Open knob:** "how fast" (movement timescales) is UNQUANTIFIED by the
  research → it's ours to calibrate to band-count + visual/sonic readability
  (sim runs ~100–260 steps; real vugs 10³–10⁶ yr). Informed by, not bound to,
  geology.

## Dark observation — what the engine actually does (2026-06-01)
`tools/movement-dark-observe.mjs` (uncommitted instrument): injects ONE movement
at RUNTIME onto a scenario (3 variants — A baseline / C trend-only / B trend+OU),
no committed file touched, no baseline regen. The first faithful step paid off
and **reframed Phase 1**:

- **F1 — temperature is ALREADY a movement.** `ambient_cooling()` runs EVERY
  step (85-simulator.ts:673): a cooling drift + stochastic thermal-pulse
  re-warming, on the **shared `rng`**. So `events:[]` never meant "T is flat."
  Movements should eventually **subsume** this (declarative TREND+PULSE on the
  dedicated reproducible stream), not run alongside it. Also: driving T with OU
  produced chaotic B−C divergence (≈60°C) — **sensitive dependence** through the
  cooling-mechanic feedback. Don't drive temperature with texture until
  ambient_cooling is reconciled.
- **F2 — Eh is frozen at 200 AND INERT.** `EH_DYNAMIC_ENABLED` (20c-chemistry-
  redox.ts:165) is OFF by default; every redox engine gates on `fluid.O2`, not
  `fluid.Eh`. **A movement on Eh is a downstream no-op until Phase 4c.** The
  headline "frozen Eh" is a Phase-4 redox-wiring gap, NOT a movements gap.
- **F3 — the live lever today is pH.** Nearly flat in baseline (CV 0.02–0.06)
  yet pivotal (every carbonate/sulfate SI + metal-solubility engine reads it).
  O2 is also live but already moved by the vadose override in supergene.
- **THESIS CONFIRMED** — driving pH down (smoothstep TREND −2 + OU σ0.12) makes
  the SI engines emit **correlated, geologically-correct** element pulses
  (elements never randomized directly):
  - `cooling` (closed): pH 6.8→5.4 curve; **Ca CV 0→0.38, CO₃ 0→0.65 UNFROZEN**
    (acidification dissolves carbonate — textbook); Fe 0.61→0.67, Mn 0.55→0.60.
  - `supergene_oxidation`: pH 6.8→5.3; **Mn 0.04→0.17 UNFROZEN**, Fe 0.14→0.22,
    S 0.64→0.76, Ca 0.13→0.42, CO₃ 0.11→0.33 — a meteoric acid front mobilizing
    metals (faithful: sulfide oxidation → H₂SO₄).
- **Q2 OU visibility — KEEP IT.** Texture is VISIBLE (3–9× the trend's
  step-to-step Δ at the smoothstep-flat ends), bounded and mean-reverting
  (clean-overlay PASS). **ramp-vs-drift is ANSWERED: BOTH** — a smoothstep TREND
  setpoint + OU texture = the research's moving-setpoint+OU model, confirmed to
  render at sim resolution.
- **Correction logged.** An early run mis-set the field path (`'pH'` vs
  `'fluid.pH'` — paths are relative to `conditions`, fluid fields live under
  `conditions.fluid.*`) → the controller silently skipped (base NaN). I
  mis-attributed the no-op to open-atmosphere pH re-solve; verified WRONG — only
  `naica` is `open_to_atmosphere`. Mechanism beats plausible narration.

**Open decisions REFRAMED for Phase 1** (was: scenario + ramp-vs-drift):
  1. **Strategy fork** — (a) drive **pH now** (the live lever; correlated pulses
     today) vs (b) flip `EH_DYNAMIC_ENABLED` / do Phase 4c FIRST so **Eh** becomes
     the master redox variable (bigger; addresses the frozen-Eh headline directly).
  2. **Pilot scenario** — `supergene_oxidation` (faithful meteoric front,
     recommended) vs `cooling` (max carbonate unfreeze) vs other.
  3. ramp-vs-drift — **resolved: keep the OU texture** (visible + bounded).

## Phase 4c — MAKE Eh LIVE (boss chose this 2026-06-02, before any pilot)
Boss decision: wire Eh to actually drive chemistry FIRST, then pilot a movement
on **`mvt`**. Rationale: a movement on an inert variable is a no-op; make it
physical first. Scoping found the redox migration is far more complete than its
comments suggested — the per-class helpers (sulfate/hydroxide/oxide×3/arsenate/
carbonate×3/sulfide×3/molybdate/phosphate/silicate/native×4) are **fully wired at
250+ call sites**, all flag-gated with a `fluid.O2` passthrough. The keystone gap:
**`fluid.Eh` is written once at init and never synced** — so flipping the flag with
frozen Eh feeds every engine a constant fake O2. The fix stages cleanly because
`ehFromO2`/`o2FromEh` are **exact inverses for O2 ∈ [0.05, 5]** (0.000% round-trip;
diverges only above O2=5, unreachable by any scenario → clamp in 4c.2).

- **✅ 4c.1 — Eh observer sync (DONE, byte-identical, NO SIM bump).**
  `_syncRedoxEh()` (85c) sets `fluid.Eh = ehFromO2(fluid.O2)` on every container
  (ring_fluids + voxels/mesh.cells), called at the END of run_step (after
  diffusion, before strip capture). Flag stays OFF → nothing reads Eh → seed-42
  byte-identical (calibration green) AND Eh not in the strip digest (also green,
  no regen). Eh now UNFREEZES on the strip (supergene Eh CV 0→0.22 tracking O2;
  cooling O2-flat→Eh pins at −75, correct). 3 tripwires in redox.test.ts.
- **✅ 4c.2 — flipped `EH_DYNAMIC_ENABLED` (DONE, SIM 167→168).** `let`+setter
  (mirrors setCarbonateKspActive). Early sync added before check_nucleation;
  end-of-step sync kept for the strip. **FluidChemistry constructor now derives
  Eh=ehFromO2(O2) when O2 given but Eh isn't** — makes hand-built fluids
  (tests/tools) redox-self-consistent under the flag; sim-invisible (the early
  sync overwrites it). 29/31 scenarios byte-identical; radioactive_pegmatite +
  schneeberg float-cascade (≤4.4e-16 round-trip ε tips a threshold), NO mineral
  lost. Baselines regen'd (seed42_v168; strip_digest byte-identical but version
  stamp). Full suite 1717/1717. Redox tests: parity blocks wrapped in
  setEhDynamicEnabled(false) using a LIVE flag read (snapshotEhDynamicFlag —
  the exported EH_DYNAMIC_ENABLED is a frozen load-time snapshot); flag-state +
  consumed-path tests added. No O2≤5 clamp needed (max observed O2≈2.2;
  o2FromEh saturates >5 gently). Commit: 4c.2.
- **✅ 4c.3a — Eh-CANONICAL mechanism (DONE, sim-neutral, no bump).** Boss chose
  "follow the science" → Eh is the master redox axis (O2 is one expression).
  `_syncRedoxEh(ehCanonical)`: default O2→Eh (the 4c.1/4c.2 view); when a movement
  drives fluid.Eh this step, flip to Eh→O2 so the movement's Eh survives to the
  engines instead of being clobbered. `MovementController.drivesFieldAt(field,
  step)` gates it; run_step passes the flag to both sync call sites. No scenario
  opts in → ehCanonical always false → byte-identical (calibration green, still
  v168). Tests: drivesFieldAt unit + injected-Eh-movement sim test (O2 derives
  from the movement's Eh). NB: vadose-override O2 writes + an Eh movement on the
  SAME cells is a per-cell-ownership conflict deferred to Phase 2; mvt (the pilot)
  is closed/no-vadose so the coarse whole-cavity flip is exact there.
- **✅ 4c.3b — `mvt` Eh-movement pilot SHIPPED (SIM 168→169). FIRST real movement.**
  Grounded in RESEARCH-mvt-redox-2026-06-02.md (deep-research, verified): MVT ore
  fluid is REDUCING during sulfide deposition (log fO2 −52…−55), but barite (a
  sulfate) belongs to an EARLIER less-reducing gangue stage — research CORRECTED my
  first sketch (an oxidizing↔reducing oscillation was wrong; discarded). Dark-
  observed both candidates (tools/mvt-redox-observe.mjs): a FLAT reducing baseline
  WIPES barite + sphalerite; the chosen **+50 → −250 mV smoothstep TREND + OU**
  preserves the full expects_species (barite kept as the early oxidizing stage,
  galena boosted 1×→4× as it reduces late) — the Tri-State paragenetic order
  (sulfate gangue early → sulfide ore late). mvt's scenarios.json5 gains a
  `movements` block; Eh-canonical (O2 follows). Only mvt changed; all other
  scenarios byte-identical; seed42_v169 + strip_digest regen; suite 1719/1719.
  **✅ LISTEN ACCEPTANCE (boss 2026-06-03): "MVT is great, i love the way it sounds."**
  The sonifier door confirms the Eh-movement reads true BY EAR — the door-test passes
  (strip + sound = same room). It sings because the Eh trend gives the redox voice a
  slow descent, OU gives it a living mean-reverting wobble, and one-master-var →
  correlated pulses means the crystal-bells play the paragenetic ORDER (barite early
  gangue → galena swelling late 1×→4×): harmony from shared causation. NO tuning
  requested. (Strip-LOOK acceptance still open, but the ear has spoken.)**

**★ The "make Eh live" arc is COMPLETE (4c.1 observer → 4c.2 consume → 4c.3a
Eh-canonical → 4c.3b first movement).** Eh went frozen+inert → live, consumed, and
drivable, with the first geological movement (mvt redox trend) shipped. The
Movements engine is now PROVEN end-to-end on a real scenario.

**★ Phase 3 — FIRST ROLLOUT SHIPPED (SIM 170, `5b589d3`): `supergene_oxidation`
meteoric acid front.** The SECOND scenario movement → the "reads true on 2
SCENARIOS" minimum-lovable-v1 (coda watch-item 4b) is HIT. Deliberately a DIFFERENT
master variable (pH, not Eh) → the engine's GENERALITY is proven, not a repeat. A
sustained acid front (pH 6.8→4.3 smoothstep + OU, startStep 20) that RECOVERS
vanadinite — a declared `expects_species` the static baseline never grew (36→40
species, expects whole). Grounded in RESEARCH-supergene-acid-front-2026-06-02.md
(Bowell 2014; Singer & Stumm 1970; verified). Pages-verified (SIM 170 + scenarios
data serve 200). **Sensory acceptance: mvt Eh trend ✅ ACCEPTED BY EAR (boss 2026-06-03,
"love the way it sounds"). supergene pH front — listen still pending** (strip shows the
supergene pH chip descending after the flush; tune by eye+ear if wanted).

**★★ MOVEMENT DESIGN RULE learned this rollout (carry forward): a same-FIELD
movement CLOBBERS same-field EVENTS.** run_step applies movements AFTER
apply_events (85-sim:184) and a movement SETS its field absolutely each step — so a
pH movement starting at step 0 ERASES an early pH-event window (supergene's acid
pulses, steps 5-16 → lost jarosite+alunite). FIX: start the movement AFTER any
same-field event window (supergene uses startStep 20, post-flush) so the events own
their window and the movement owns the rest — they COMPOSE. mvt was immune (its
movement drove Eh while events drove S/Zn/Pb). When opting a new scenario in, check
whether any event touches the movement's field and start after it.

Next arcs: Phase 3 continues (more scenarios/archetypes opt in, each its own commit
+ look+listen) and Phase 2 fluid-source spots (spatial).

**★★★ PHASE 3 COVERAGE MAP (surveyed 2026-06-02 via tools/movement-assemblage-
observe.mjs — observed 7+ candidates, the homework behind "totality").** A clean
temporal-movement target needs a lever that is (a) FLAT in baseline, (b) the
load-bearing GEOLOGICAL driver, and (c) assemblage-preserving. Across the roster
that set is SMALL — most scenarios are gated. The honest map:
- **✅ CLEAN + SHIPPED (2):** `mvt` (Eh reducing trend), `supergene_oxidation`
  (pH acid front). These are the scenarios where all three conditions hold.
- **⛔ T-BLOCKED (the biggest gated class — needs the ambient_cooling reconciliation
  sub-project first):** `cooling`, `naica_geothermal`, `marble_contact_metamorphism`,
  `gem_pegmatite`, `radioactive_pegmatite`, `porphyry`, `epithermal_telluride`
  (boiling≈T; a pH-up movement can't recover its native_gold — boiling→Au isn't
  pH-driven in-engine), `deccan_zeolite`. Temperature is their master variable and
  the engine can't yet move it (ambient_cooling is an ad-hoc T movement on the
  shared rng; OU-on-T diverges chaotically). **Unblocking T is the single largest
  "totality" lever — ~8 scenarios.**
- **⚠ EVENT-CONFOUNDED redox (lever already event-driven, not flat):** `bisbee`
  (Eh −150→322 rollercoaster), `schneeberg` (Eh −200→322). A movement just fights
  the scripted swings. To move these, SUBSUME their redox events into a movement
  (the "movements subsume ad-hoc events" vision) — a per-scenario refactor.
- **⚠ BASELINE-DEBT (fails many expects regardless of movement):** `roughten_gill`
  (8 expects missing), `sunnyside_american_tunnel` (4 missing). Calibration debt,
  not a movement target — fix the broth first.
- **⚠ ASSEMBLAGE-COST (the geologically-right movement loses an expects):**
  `sicily_solfifera` (reducing trend right for biogenic S but shrinks native_sulfur
  87→1µm + kills celestine in-engine), `colorado_plateau` (VERIFIED: reducing Eh
  wipes the oxidized U(VI) uranyl-vanadates). Engine doesn't reward these yet.
- **⚠ CONCENTRATION-CONFOUNDED (evaporites; concentration already vadose-cycled):**
  `sabkha_dolomitization`, `searles_lake`. The lever isn't flat (vadose ratchets it).
- **○ ALKALINE / specialized (no clean acid-front):** `ultramafic_supergene` (pH 8.5),
  `jeffrey_mine` (pH 10 serpentinite). A different (alkalinity) story, not yet modeled.
- **— EXCLUDED by design (testing / tutorial / demo):** `pulse`, `reactive_wall`,
  `tn457_barite_pulses`, `tutorial_*` (separate rework package), `stalactite_demo`,
  `zoned_dripstone_cave`, `ouro_preto` (pH movement safe but not its headline driver).

**TOTALITY VERDICT:** the temporal pH/Eh movement feature is COMPLETE at its clean
set (2 scenarios) — baking unmotivated movements would violate follow-the-science.
Broad coverage requires real sub-projects, in leverage order: (1) **T-reconciliation**
(subsume ambient_cooling → unlocks ~8 cooling/hydrothermal/metamorphic scenarios —
the biggest unlock), (2) **event-subsumption** (bisbee/schneeberg redox events →
movements), (3) **baseline calibration** (roughten_gill/sunnyside). Each is its own
arc. (Boss 2026-06-02: pH/Eh temporal feature ACCEPTED as done at its clean set;
pivoted to Phase 2.)

## Phase 2 — FLUID-SOURCE SPOTS (spatial), active 2026-06-02
"The specific points where things enter the vugg" (boss). Cracks/geysers/hotspots —
seeded wall entry points (PROPOSAL §10). Sub-steps: 2a seed+observe (dark) → 2b
wall-decay bonus → 2c origin-rides-spots + deposition bias → 2d open/close events.
- **✅ 2a DONE (dark scaffold, byte-identical, NO SIM bump).** `js/85k-fluid-spots.ts`:
  `FluidSpot {cell,kind,open,supply,decayBonus}` + `_seedFluidSpots(shape_seed,
  cellCount, opts)` off a DEDICATED `_mulberry32(shape_seed ^ 0x53504f54)` stream
  (independent of the shared rng → seeding draws nothing from the nucleation
  cascade) + a no-op-safe `FluidSpotField` (empty set = neutral everywhere). The sim
  constructor seeds `this._fluidSpots` after the mesh is built; scenarios may pin
  count/kinds via a `fluid_spots` block (threaded in 70-events). DARK: stored, NOT
  consumed → seed-42 + strip-digest byte-identical (regen confirmed no drift).
  Observed (tools/fluid-spots-observe.mjs): count distribution {0:6,1:10,2:12,3:1,4:1}
  across 30 scenarios (mode 1-2, ~20% zero — as designed), sensible floor/wall/ceiling
  positions, reproducible (same shape_seed → identical spots; scenarios sharing a
  shape_seed share spots). GOTCHA fixed: the built+cached mesh AND shape_seed live on
  `sim.wall_state` (WallState), NOT `sim.conditions.wall` (the VugWall config) — read
  spatial state from wall_state. Tests: tests-js/fluid-spots.test.ts (9).
- **✅ 2b DONE (SIM 170→171): FEEDER-LOCALIZED erosion, the first coupling.** Open
  spots redistribute the FIXED wall-dissolution budget toward their columns
  (`FluidSpotField.columnWeights` → `erodeCells(rateMm, blocked, colWeights)` via
  `dissolve_wall`), so the cavity deepens LOPSIDEDLY toward feeders. Gated by
  `fluidSpotsDecayEnabled()` (default on). MASS-CONSERVING (same total wall_depth →
  Ca/CO3 release computed upstream is untouched → PURELY GEOMETRIC). Only fires
  where the wall dissolves (acidic, pH<5.5; silicate veins inert). Observed (A/B):
  porphyry crack@col43 0.86→1.37mm (1.59× mean), hotspot 1.29×; bisbee col8 1.30×;
  mean preserved; **assemblage IDENTICAL**. **★ PAGES-IS-THE-GAME case:** render-
  visible (cavity shape) but BYTE-IDENTICAL on seed-42 + strip-digest (verified
  stamp-only v170→v171) — the baselines capture chemistry/assemblage, not raw
  geometry. So the geometry is PINNED by 2 new tests in fluid-spots.test.ts
  (ON→lopsided + mean preserved; OFF→uniform) rather than the baseline. SIM bumped
  because the rendered output changed. **Boss: the lopsided cavity is the look — on
  acidic scenarios (porphyry/bisbee/supergene) the vug should be visibly deeper
  toward its feeder columns.**
- **✅ 2c.1 DONE (dark mechanism + observer, byte-identical, NO SIM bump): origin:'cell'
  spatial injection.** `MovementController.applyStep(conditions, step, sim)` gained a sim
  handle (run_step passes `this`; 2-arg callers degrade safely to global). For an
  `origin:'cell'` movement it PINS one seeded cell's `mesh.cells[idx].fluid[leaf]` to the
  movement value each step (a fixed-composition feeder) and SKIPS the bulk set, so run_step's
  `_propagateGlobalDelta` is a no-op for it and the step-end `_diffuseRingState` carries the
  value outward. Origin resolved ONCE at first window activation (`_resolveOriginCell`):
  explicit `m.originCell` → a seeded pick among `FluidSpotField.openSpots()` → `_pickOriginCell`
  fallback (one draw from the dedicated movement stream → reproducible, independent of the
  nucleation rng). DARK: no scenario declares origin:'cell' → seed-42 + strip-digest byte-
  identical (regen-confirmed). Tests: 5 new in movements.test.ts (pin-one-cell + leave-bulk-and-
  conditions-untouched, open-spot resolution incl. skip-closed, no-spots fallback, 2-arg back-
  compat, reproducibility). Observer: **tools/fluid-spot-origin-observe.mjs**.
  - **★ KEY ARCHITECTURE FINDING (load-bearing, was a stale-comment trap):** per-cell
    `mesh.cells[].fluid` are INDEPENDENT clones (Tranche 4c) and are **DECOUPLED** from
    `ring_fluids`/`conditions.fluid` — writing one does NOT update the other (proof:
    85c-simulator-state.ts:152-168, the vadose override must explicitly mirror writes to
    BOTH because "the mesh-only path left ring_fluids[r] alone, so the nucleation gate never
    saw it"). The LEGACY nucleation gate + placement read ring_fluids; only the STRIP view +
    the per-vertex sampler read mesh.cells. ⇒ a cell injection is strip/per-vertex-VISIBLE but
    **assemblage-NEUTRAL on its own** (byte-identical seed-42, like 2b). Assemblage-level
    one-sided GROWTH needs the deposition bias (2c.2) to bite the legacy placement. (Fixed the
    stale Tranche-1 comment at 85-sim:131 that claimed `cells[i].fluid === ring_fluids[r]`.)
  - **OBSERVED (supergene seed-23, pH trend 6.8→4.3 at the hotspot@cell1002 feeder, texture
    off):** the gradient is REAL and correctly SHARP for a point source + slow diffusion
    (rate 0.05) — acid pinned at d=0 (pH 4.93) recovers to bulk (6.52) within ~8 graph-hops,
    then flat; GLOBAL gives a uniform bulk drop (per-cell spread 0.00). So `origin:'cell'` is
    NOT a drop-in for a global movement: it models a DIFFERENT geology (a point feeder
    decorating a local halo — the Punjab hematite case), not pervasive supergene acid. Pick
    the 2c.3 demonstrator accordingly (a distinct point-source fluid into an otherwise-static
    cavity), NOT supergene's pervasive front.
- **2c.2 column-bias (DARK, default-off, v171 commit 3c17e49) — a verify-the-mechanism CATCH,
  SUPERSEDED by 2c.2b.** Weighting the legacy ring0 COLUMN pick by open-feeder `supply`
  (columnSupplyWeights) did NOT visibly cluster: gem_pegmatite's feeder columns [107,114,78]
  captured **0 crystals OFF and ON** (a feeder is a 2-D patch, not a thin vertical stripe; the
  column pick is sparse + bypassed). It only reshuffled competition. Kept default-off (the
  column helper remains as a sibling query to columnWeights). The fix → 2c.2b.
- **✅ 2c.2b DONE (SIM 172, PER-SCENARIO OPT-IN): per-cell PROXIMITY-DECAY deposition
  CLUSTERING — the visible "best crystals cluster near the feeder."** `FluidSpotField.proximityField(N,R)`
  = per-cell boost `1 + max_f[(supply_f−1)·PEAK_K·exp(−dist/LAMBDA)]` (dist = lat-long graph
  distance; default PEAK_K=12, LAMBDA=2.5), a multiplicative weight in BOTH placement samplers:
  the geometry-only `_feederProximitySample` (joint (ring,col) draw weighted by
  ringAreaWeight·proximity — clusters free-wall nucleation, reuses the `_lastNucVertexRing`
  handoff) and the per-vertex σ-sampler (`w *= proximity`, finally feeding that σ-starved sampler
  its missing spatial heterogeneity). proximity≡1 → ring-marginal reduces to the legacy area
  distribution → byte-identical.
  **PER-SCENARIO OPT-IN** (`fluid_spots: { deposition: true }` → `sim._fluidSpotsDeposition`),
  NOT global, because a global default perturbed a VALIDATED-chemistry scenario: reactive_wall's
  marginal PWP precipitation contract (calcite at equilibrium, ~2e-9) flipped when its calcite
  clustered (2946→2159µm). Clustering mustn't silently rewrite scenarios testing other physics.
  v172 enables exactly ONE demonstrator — **gem_pegmatite** (3 hotspots → 0→18% of crystals
  within 2 cells of a feeder; tourmaline 2→5, cassiterite 1→4 concentrate at the vents). The
  observer/tests force it for any sim via the tri-state master override
  `setFluidSpotsDepositionEnabled(null|true|false)` → `fluidSpotsDepositionFor(sim)`.
  **Measured (override-on A/B, K12/λ2.5):** within-2-cells share ~0-2%→~11-18% fleet-wide;
  assemblage PRESERVED everywhere, **0 expects_species lost** — so widening the opt-in is SAFE.
  **Baseline:** seed42_v171→v172 = gem_pegmatite ONLY (29/30 byte-identical incl. reactive_wall);
  strip_digest stamp-only (gem_pegmatite not in the digest set). FILES: js/85k (proximityField +
  clustering params + tri-state override + fluidSpotsDepositionFor), js/85b
  (_feederProximitySample + per-vertex prox multiply), js/85 (opt-in read), data/scenarios.json5
  (gem_pegmatite), tools/fluid-spots-deposition-observe.mjs, tests in fluid-spots.test.ts.
  **⚠ CALIBRATION OPEN (boss's eye):** v172 is a restrained, calibratable PREVIEW on ONE
  scenario. Strength = `setDepositionClustering(PEAK_K, LAMBDA)` (K12/λ2.5 ≈ broadest lobe;
  K25-50/λ1.5-2 ≈ tighter cores). Scope = which scenarios opt in (global is safe per the A/B).
  Boss to look at gem_pegmatite on Pages + steer strength + which scenarios.
- **✅ 2c.3 DONE (SIM 173→174): the UNITED point-source showpiece on gem_pegmatite.** An
  `origin:'cell'` movement injects a BORON halo (field fluid.B, startStep 30, trend +100 eased,
  clampMax 120 = the strip-chip scale) at the cavity's dominant feeder, so the chemical halo
  (strip-visible) sits at the SAME equatorial vent where tourmaline CLUSTERS (2c.2b, baked v172)
  and the cavity DEEPENS (2b, live — gem_pegmatite hits pH 3.53). One feeder, three signals:
  shape + chemistry + crystals. Anchored to the step-30 "Schorl Arrives (B supersaturation)"
  event — the feeder delivers the boron that brings schorl. To make halo + cluster COINCIDE,
  `_resolveOriginCell` (85j) now picks the most EQUATORIAL open spot (highest ringAreaWeight) —
  it resolves to hotspot@954 (ring 7); B 96.7 at feeder → 34.9 bulk (the lone polar feeder the
  random pick used before had 0 crystals). **HONEST SCOPE (verify-the-mechanism):** the injection
  is a per-cell CHEMICAL halo (strip + per-vertex visible), DECOUPLED from the legacy ring-fluid
  nucleation gate, and these growth engines are NOT nutrient-rate-limited (observed: even +4000 B
  left tourmaline 3×451 unchanged). So 2c.3 unites halo + cluster by spatial CO-LOCATION at the
  feeder, NOT by the halo driving growth → seed42 + strip_digest BYTE-IDENTICAL v173→v174
  (gem_pegmatite isn't in the digest set; the B halo is purely strip/render-visible) — the
  2b/2c.1 pattern, SIM bumps for the rendered change. The `_resolveOriginCell` equatorial change
  was FREE (no scenario had baked origin:'cell' before v174). Tool: tools/showpiece-observe.mjs
  (halo + one-sided-growth + expects-safety A/B). Tests: equatorial-pick unit (movements.test.ts)
  + gem_pegmatite halo-at-feeder integration (fluid-spots.test.ts). FILES: js/85j (_resolveOriginCell),
  data/scenarios.json5 (gem_pegmatite movements).
  **★★ The Phase 2 FLUID-SPOTS arc is COMPLETE end-to-end: 2a seed → 2b erosion → 2c.1 halo →
  2c.2 (catch) → 2c.2b clustering → 2c.3 united showpiece → 2d lifecycle.**
- **✅ 2d DONE (SIM 172→173): spots OPEN/CLOSE via events — the plumbing lives.** A
  DECLARATIVE `spots` directive on an event spec (`'seal' | 'breach' | {action, kind}`)
  → `apply_events` (85d) toggles the cavity's feeders CENTRALLY after `apply_fn` (one
  edit point, no per-handler changes). `FluidSpotField.sealSpots(pred)/breachSpots(pred)`
  close/open matching spots (pred = undefined=all | kind string | fn) + bust the
  proximityField memo (it caches by (N,R,K,λ), NOT the open-set — a sealed feeder must
  not keep clustering from a stale cache; the live-read couplings columnWeights/openSpots/
  decayMultiplierAt need no busting). `js/70-events` carries `spots: ev.spots` onto the
  event object. Because every coupling already filters on `spot.open`, the flip propagates
  for FREE — feeders go live/dead, 2b erosion + 2c clustering follow. Demonstrator:
  **supergene_oxidation** step-160 `Fracture Seal` gains `"spots": "seal"` — its lone
  hotspot@921 seals (open 1→0), 2b columnWeights → null, the lopsided deepening FREEZES
  at the seal (self-sealing = "the fill is ending"). Render-visible but seed42 + strip-
  digest **BYTE-IDENTICAL v172→v173** (the 2b geometry it gates is mass-conserving;
  baselines capture chemistry not geometry) → SIM bumps for the rendered change, behavior
  PINNED by 3 tests in fluid-spots.test.ts (seal/breach toggle + prox-memo invalidation +
  event-driven supergene seal). FILES: js/85k (seal/breachSpots), js/85d (directive),
  js/70-events (passthrough), data/scenarios.json5 (supergene). **breach API ready +
  unit-tested; no scenario declares it yet** (needs a seal-then-reopen sequence — a
  future scenario, e.g. tectonic_uplift/aquifer_recharge breaching after a seal).
- **SHOWPIECE (boss look, banked from chat):** `supergene_oxidation` + `shape_seed 23`
  is the strongest 2b lopsided cavity — 3 feeders incl. a crack (1.6×) carve it ~1.8×
  deeper on one side (mean wall_depth ~41mm, feeder lobe ~74mm, 34mm bulge). supergene
  wins because its acid front dissolves the most wall → biggest absolute bulge. Seeds
  16/15/14 similar (14 = twin crack). Default supergene (shape_seed 7) has 1 hotspot
  (subtle). porphyry default = cleanest uniform→single-bulge A/B but small (~0.5mm).
- **OPEN QUESTION (boss feedback pending):** is 2b's lopsidedness VISIBLE ENOUGH on the
  3D render vs the existing 'irregular' architecture variance? If too subtle, the
  decay bonuses (1.2-1.6×) want amplifying — a cheap tune in _KIND_DEFAULTS (85k).
  Also: erodeCells is RING0-only (equatorial slices) — the bulge is an equatorial-plane
  asymmetry; a per-(ring,col) erosion model would make spots deepen at their actual
  latitude (bigger refactor, future).
- **Latent note:** even flag-ON, the helpers use the coarse `ehFromO2` bijection,
  NOT the principled Nernst couples (`REDOX_COUPLES`/`redoxFraction`, built in 4a,
  still uncalled). Richer per-couple redox is a later refinement, not 4c.

## Verification tools (this project)
- `tools/broth-stability-probe.mjs` — re-run after each migration; the flat-%
  should drop and the volatile (redox-led) elements should move. NB: much of the
  baseline "flat %" is spectator ions (Na/K/Mg/Cl) + inert Eh — not all stasis is
  a defect. The pivotal-but-flat fields (Ca/CO₃/Mn in closed scenarios) are the
  real targets, and a single pH movement unfreezes them.
- `tools/movement-dark-observe.mjs` — the A/C/B observation harness above; run
  before opting any scenario in, to ground the oracle and pick field + amplitude
  (trajectory + correlated-CV view; does NOT report assemblage survival).
- `tools/movement-assemblage-observe.mjs` — **the Phase-3 rollout instrument** (the
  generalized successor to mvt-redox-observe; any scenario+field). BASE/FLAT/TREND
  ASSEMBLAGE SURVIVAL — does the movement keep the scenario's `expects_species`? —
  plus the full Δ-vs-baseline assemblage + correlated-CV table. Reads
  `expects_species` from `SCENARIOS[scen]._json5_spec`. Run THIS before baking; the
  shape that reads true in prose can still wipe a headline mineral (the mvt-barite
  + supergene-vanadinite tensions both surfaced here). Args (positional, startStep
  before the rarely-used clampMax): `<scen> <field> <base> <amp> <sigma> <clampMin>
  <startStep> <clampMax>`. **Verified finding (don't re-attempt): `colorado_plateau`
  roll-front U with a reducing Eh trend WIPES carnotite+tyuyamunite — they're
  oxidized U(VI) uranyl-vanadates, so reduction destroys them. Roll-front U is NOT
  a reducing-Eh pilot; its target assemblage IS the oxidized expression.**
- The strip view + sonifier ARE the look+listen instruments for the pilot.

# PART II — CARRIED BACKLOG (distilled + current)

> **`proposals/BACKLOG.md` holds the full 630-line history.** ⚠️ It is partly
> STALE: its Python↔JS parity items are **DEAD** (Python tree deleted
> 2026-05-07 — JS-only now), and its SIM_VERSION section reads "7" (actual:
> 167). Trust THIS snapshot for what's live. Grouped by theme, roughly by
> actionability. "mine/boss-lane" noted where it matters.

### A. Sonifier / strip-as-instrument — musicality (open, ongoing)
The boss's standing "how do we make it more musical" thread. Lanes:
**looping** (boss's earlier next-simplest pick), **reverb/space** (cheapest
remaining win — decay could derive from cavity size = honest), melody-over-
drone, moving harmony. Seasonings: velocity-from-rate-of-change, detune/chorus.
**Data gap:** no Mohs/luster/crystal-system in minerals.json → crystal timbre
is color+size only; a per-mineral acoustic table would unlock "harder=brighter,
metallic=clink." (jsdom is deaf — the SOUND needs a human ear. Already shipped
this arc: pan-from-angle + continuous "raw rock" mode, `0db9fca`.)

### B. Crystal-Cipher / "crystal language" sub-project (PROPOSAL-CRYSTAL-CIPHER.md)
Deterministic regeneration of shared structured content as an agent-friendly
messaging substrate (recipe URL → ~5 MB regenerated corpus → coordinate
selection decodes the message; ~60,000× compression; the simulator source IS
the shared codebook). **Reproducibility-critical** — this is *why* movements
must be seed-linked (Part I). Substrate enrichments proposed: real crystal
lattices (space groups / Wyckoff / Miller), UV-fluorescence trace channels,
helicoid-as-Scytale (winding params = transposition key). Conceptual; depends
on strip-view bedrock (shipped) + per-vertex spatial chemistry.

### C. Thermo tail (flagged in-data; not urgent — mine-lane)
Run `tools/thermo-coverage-check.mjs --verify`/`--internal` before/after.
- **dolomite ΔH** −28 vs wateq4f −39.5 (engine-promoted; needs a
  vugg-tune-scenario calibration pass; shifts seed-42).
- **siderite ΔH** −20 vs −10.4/−16 — verify Bénézeth 2009 full text first
  (feeds SI_siderite chip → digest drift).
- **witherite ΔGf** −1132.2 ~0.9 log-units adrift — non-fatal review.

### D. Geological-Accuracy phases (PROPOSAL-GEOLOGICAL-ACCURACY.md)
Phases 1+2 shipped. Open: **Phase 3** CO₂ degassing as a precipitation driver
(partly present via `70l-co2-events`; couples with PROPOSAL-VOLATILE-GASES).
**Phase 4** dynamic pH/Eh redox couples (Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺, Mn⁴⁺/Mn²⁺, SO₄/HS⁻) —
**NOTE: largely SUBSUMED by the Movements project's redox-unfreezing**; reconcile
rather than duplicate. **Phase 5** solid-solution composition tracking
(continuous mole-fraction; unblocks twin retune + 3D habit bias). **Phase 6**
CNT rate gates (lowest priority). Also Phase 1e (unify dissolution credits) +
2d (per-scenario fluid recalibration so ACTIVITY_DAMPING can rise).

### E. Strip-contract campaign
Author strip contracts (grow-digest + chip-envelope) for gem_pegmatite, marble,
evaporites — extend the test-instrument coverage the way bisbee/supergene got.

### F. Future scenarios
Sweetwater (snowball barite) + Elmwood (calcite-after-fluorite perimorph) — MVT,
may need scenario-specific paragenesis tunings. Cobalt-Ontario/Freiberg Ag vein
(activates nickeline+cobaltite+native_silver). Acid-mine-drainage (activates
chalcanthite). Plus the D3-gated scenarios (H below).
- **Specimen-anchored MVT scenario from the boss's own collection (boss, 2026-06-02;
  "sometime down the line").** Boss owns 30+ MVT calcites + fluorites + barites +
  sphalerites, probably galena (unconfirmed — resolve from the shelf; galena
  presence calibrates the depth of the reducing Eh excursion). That assemblage is
  the EXACT `mvt` expects_species (sphalerite, galena, fluorite, barite, calcite),
  so this is mostly a CALIBRATION of the existing literature-anchored `mvt` against
  real specimens (habit/color/paragenetic order), via the vugg-add-scenario
  specimen-anchored workflow — NOT a from-scratch build. The "replication of life"
  north star applied to his rocks; the richer successor to today's Tri-State-lit
  `mvt` + its Eh-movement (4c.3b). NB 30+ pieces likely span sub-districts
  (Tri-State / Elmwood TN / Cave-in-Rock IL / Moroccan-Spanish barite) → decide
  one representative scenario vs sub-district variants from the specimens. Inputs
  can flow from the 1217-specimen mineral catalog once iPhone-capture is live.
  FUTURE CONTEXT, not a current requirement — needs photos/labels in hand.

### G. Mineral engines — pre-researched, pure engine work (use vugg-add-mineral)
- **Cd + greenockite** (CdS yellow on Tri-State sphalerite; Cd field).
- **Au-Te coupling**: calaverite + sylvanite (Bingham telluride cap; Te plumbed).
- **Auriferous-chalcocite** trace tracking (Bisbee — Au hosted in chalcocite).
- **Ag/Ge engines** (Tsumeb): proustite, pyrargyrite, native_silver,
  chlorargyrite, germanite, renierite (Ag/Ge already in fluid).
- **Halides**: atacamite, chlorargyrite, boleite (Cl plumbed).

### H. Diamond / mantle "D3" plumbing cluster (long runway — end of 200-list)
Heavy shared plumbing (carbon field + pressure-as-real-supersat-driver + mantle
T/P regime) pays for ~15-20 minerals: Al₂SiO₅ polymorphs (kyanite/andalusite/
sillimanite), coesite/stishovite, jadeite/omphacite/lawsonite/glaucophane,
olivine-peridot, enstatite, diopside, pyrope, spinel, phlogopite, ilmenite,
chromite, perovskite, **diamond** (capstone). Enables blueschist / impact-crater
/ kimberlite scenarios. D2 bridge: xenocryst diamond in a shell kimberlite.

### I. Tutorials rework (separate work package, post-Phase-3)
Tutorial system is slated for its own rework arc.

### J. Twin-probability retune (deferred)
Per-roll twin rates don't account for per-mineral lifetime step-count. Build a
tool (extend `tools/twin_rate_check`) to count observed in-game twin frequency
per mineral at seed-42 vs literature; retune per-mineral (not blanket). Wants
Phase-5 continuous composition first. Candidates: cerussite cyclic_sixling,
sphalerite spinel-law, calcite c-twin, arsenopyrite trillings.

### K. 3D loose ends
- **bornite + magnetite** dropped from seed-42 (porphyry / deccan_zeolite) by
  per-ring chemistry fragmentation; tune fluid or add a seed-pulse, restore
  expects_species.
- Water-level **proportional (RC-circuit) drainage** polish (v26 uses constant
  rate).
- Dripstone **aspect-ratio** refinement (cave stalactites are slimmer, 10-20:1).

### L. Creative-mode controls
Wall **porosity slider** (designed: surface-area × matrix-leaching × residence-
time; needs wall_K/Na/Si/Al_ppm schema). Wall **composition picker** (limestone/
dolomite/silicate). Full element-slider exposure (every starter-fluid element
visible at setup).

### M. Narrative cleanups (small)
Verify whether JS narrators for borax/tincalconite/halite/mirabilite/thenardite
are still missing (port from the dead Python if so — last reference predates the
Python deletion). Auto-generate `_NARRATIVE_MANIFEST` from MINERAL_SPEC. Drop
inline JS narrator fallbacks (likely moot post-extraction — verify).

### N. Internal token rename (cosmetic, deferred)
`fortress*`→Creative, `legendsSim`→Simulation, `idle*`→Zen, `groove*`→Record
Player. ~199/40/30 occurrences; breadcrumbs in place. No UX gain; pure churn.

### Q. Performance / optimization (flagged boss 2026-06-01 — "down the line")
**Symptom:** computer fans spin up on **new-vug GENERATION** (not during the
run) → the cost is in the synchronous SETUP path, not the step loop. Suspects to
PROFILE (observe-before-assert; don't pre-optimize): the wall-mesh build
(bubble placement / tessellation in 22-geometry-wall), the cavity voxel-grid
construction (4 depth slices × cells — `voxelGridFor`, v158/159), per-cell
chemistry binding (`bindRingChemistry`), and the initial diffusion warm-up
(`_diffuseFull`/`_diffuseRingState`, v160). Likely a one-time O(cells)–O(cells²)
setup cost. Deferred — not now, and NOT to derail the movements arc. When picked
up: build a timing probe first (match the gen-baseline/calibration-sweep tool
pattern), profile, then optimize the actual hotspot. NB: the fluid-source-spots
design (§10) already reduces per-step RNG by using a bounded precomputed origin
set instead of per-parcel rolls — perf and geology aligned there.

### P. Frontier gaps toward byte-identical (exposed 2026-06-02 — LOWER PRIORITY than the active Movements arc; documented so the knowledge carries forward)
The boss stress-tested the finish line with three real specimens (a Treece-KS
sphalerite+calcite, a quartz-druse vug with internal bridges, a query about
angel-wing calcite). The honest map: "simulate life / byte-identical" needs FOUR
axes all true, and these specimens cleanly separate them. **Do NOT pull these
ahead of the Movements arc** — they're the long game. Captured per axis:

- **(1) Chemistry fidelity** — the axis we're ON (Eh live, movements). Coarsest
  grain; real progress. Keep climbing it (the active work).
- **(2) Morphology / individual-resolution texture** — the BIG forward gap and the
  precondition for inversion (you can't invert to an individual the forward model
  can't even render). Today's model emits STYLIZED primitives + habit tokens, not
  etch pits / step-bunching / growth striations / phantoms / twin re-entrants /
  included blebs at individual resolution. Sub-items exposed:
  - **Angel-wing calcite is MISSING.** Calcite is only `scalenohedral_or_
    rhombohedral` with a single {0001} c_twin (prob 0.1). Angel-wing = a tabular
    wing/butterfly CONTACT twin — absent as both habit and twin. (The only "angel"
    in-code is *angelite* = lavender anhydrite, unrelated.) MVT-associated
    (Linwood, IA) → natural add for the collection arc: `vugg-add-twin-law` + a
    wing primitive (99c/99d) + habit token (07).
  - **Sphalerite under-grows in `mvt`** — galena reaches ~7 mm while sphalerite
    stays ~µm; the ore proportions are INVERTED vs real Tri-State (sphalerite is
    the dominant ore). A calibration gap (vugg-tune-scenario) — and a clean
    "replicate what you see" failure to fix.
  - **Per-individual surface/interior texture** — the deep one. Phantoms,
    striation spacing, etch figures are the deterministic RECORD of the contingent
    history; they must EMERGE from truer + FINER physics, not be painted on. See
    the North Star "what byte-identical means" block. **Natural bridge from the
    current arc:** a phantom IS a movement event frozen into the crystal, and the
    strip recorder already stores the movement trajectory — so rendering phantoms
    FROM the recorded movement trajectory is the first faithful step up the
    resolution axis, and it composes directly with Movements.
- **(3) Topology** — internal **septa / bridges** that subdivide a cavity (Keokuk-
  geode style) are NOT representable: the cavity is a single closed surface (rings
  × cells around one interior); grep for septa/bridge/partition is empty. Origin:
  incomplete dissolution leaves host-rock/silica walls, then crystal coats
  everything. A cavity-geometry arc (22-geometry-wall) — distinct from chemistry.
  (The even quartz-DRUSE half of that specimen IS reproducible today — wall
  nucleation across the whole surface is the default growth mode.)
- **(4) Inversion (photo → recipe)** — the literal stop-condition; see coda §1
  (factors through the strip trajectory). Unbuilt. **Ordering note:** axis (2)
  forward-resolution must precede (4) — there's nothing to invert TO until the
  forward model emits individual-resolution texture. Don't build the inverse leg
  first.

### O. RESOLVED / DONE (don't re-open)
- **Per-vertex placement flip** — investigated v167, deliberately NOT globally
  flipped (scale-starved); area-skew bug fixed. Stays opt-in. Don't re-attempt
  the naive flip (HANDOFF-PER-VERTEX-PLACEMENT.md).
- **Canonical minerals.json** — FIXED 2026-06-01 (`083d994`).
- **multidim merge** — DONE (folded into vugg, 3dc858c).

### DEAD (do not action — historical only in BACKLOG.md)
- All **Python↔JS parity** items (effectiveTemperature port, silica_equilibrium,
  supersat-drift reconciliation, sync-spec Check 7, scenario_random parity,
  Python A6–A8 refactor): Python is deleted. JS is canonical.

## ☆ Builder's note to the next builder (coda, 2026-06-01)

Things worth carrying that aren't fully captured above:

1. **The inverse problem (the finish line) probably factors through the strip
   dataset.** "Photo → recipe" direct is brutally ill-posed. But the strip
   dataset (the fluid TRAJECTORY) is the deterministic interface between a
   specimen and its recipe — and a crystal's zoning literally IS its recorded
   trajectory. So the inverse likely decomposes: *photo → trajectory* (read the
   zoning — hard, but it's reading what nature already wrote down) → *trajectory
   → recipe* (seeds + settings that reproduce it — low-dimensional, tractable).
   The Movements engine is building the recipe→trajectory leg. So Movements
   isn't only forward-faithfulness — it's the **middle leg of backward
   compatibility**. Design the strip dataset asking "could I invert from this?"

2. **The convergence heuristic.** This session, "cheaper," "truer," and "more
   invertible" kept landing on the SAME choice (fluid-source spots were all
   three). That's the signature of a good parameterization. Rule: when a choice
   is at once more efficient, more geologically honest, AND more invertible,
   trust it hard. If making something prettier costs truth or invertibility,
   be suspicious — you've probably left the science.

3. **First thing to check in Phase 1:** is the OU fine-texture even visible at
   sim resolution (~100–260 steps, post-downsample)? Holten's anti-persistence
   is at the zoning-band scale, finer than our step. If it's below the noise
   floor, rip it — don't tune an invisible parameter.

4. **Two watch-items.** (a) The suite proves *determinism*, not *correctness* —
   build the geological oracle FROM the first dark observation, never blind
   (the too-tight-contract trap). (b) The arc's risk is *convergence*, not
   capability — lock a minimum-lovable v1 (broth measurably less flat, reads
   true on 2 scenarios) before coupling spots/spatial.

5. When the science contradicts your plan, that's the compass working, not a
   setback. The best moves this session were the two corrections (red-noise →
   mean-reverting; iron → solubility cycling). Stay glad to be wrong.

### ☆☆ Addendum — the "make Eh live" session (2026-06-02)

What shipped: the whole **Eh-live arc** — 4c.1 observer (Eh tracks O2) → 4c.2
consume (engines read Eh) → 4c.3a Eh-canonical (a movement can drive Eh) → 4c.3b
the **first real geological movement** (mvt reducing-Eh trend). SIM 167→169, suite
green throughout, all on Syntaxswine. Eh went from frozen+inert to live, consumed,
drivable, with a science-grounded movement on a real scenario. The dark-observation
that opened the session is what found Eh was the gap.

What I learned (carry these):
- **Observe before you build, every time.** The dark observation found Eh wasn't
  just frozen but *inert*; it found the barite-tension in the mvt movement; it
  corrected my movement shape from a wrong oscillation to a reducing trend. Almost
  every good call this session came from running a no-commit observation FIRST.
  Build the oracle from observation, never from a plausible story (I narrated an
  "open-atmosphere clobbers pH" diagnosis that was just a wrong field path — verify
  the mechanism, don't trust the narration).
- **The boss will keep raising your sights to the individual.** I under-shot the
  finish line twice — first missing inversion, then missing individuality/texture.
  The target is always *that crystal*, not a plausible member of its type. Don't
  offer type-matches as progress. (See the North Star "what byte-identical means"
  block — the load-bearing reframe of the session.)
- **Green suite ≠ shipped. Functional on GitHub Pages = shipped** (boss). The suite
  validates the engine; the game is the browser. After a player-facing push, verify
  the live URL (serving + data 200s). Sonifier audio + visual render are the boss's
  senses / a real browser — not something jsdom or curl can judge.
- **Follow-the-science is a live corrective, not a slogan.** The MVT deep-research
  killed my oscillating-pulse design and replaced it with a reducing trend; it's
  what made the pilot true. Run the research, verify the citations (never fabricate
  — v145), let it overrule you.

What I'd have the next builder do, in order:
1. **Finish the Movements arc (highest priority, the active work).** Get the boss's
   look+listen on the mvt pilot → tune the trend by eye+ear → then Phase 3
   (roll movements out to more scenarios, each deep-researched + dark-observed +
   its own commit/regen) and Phase 2 (fluid-source spots — the spatial,
   one-sided-growth layer). This is coherent, in-flight, and grounded.
2. **Then the frontier axes (§P), LOWER priority, in the right order:** forward
   individual-resolution texture BEFORE inversion. The cleanest first bite that
   composes with what exists: **render phantoms from the recorded movement
   trajectory** — a phantom is a movement frozen into the crystal, the strip
   already stores the trajectory, and it's the first faithful step up the
   resolution axis toward "that crystal." Angel-wing calcite + the mvt
   sphalerite/galena proportion fix are clean, bounded, MVT-arc-aligned wins.
3. **Keep the disciplines that make the finish line reachable:** verify sources,
   defer to geology, observe before assert, never fabricate, Pages-is-the-game.
   The destination is inevitable only if every step is science-true.

This is a years-long cathedral. Build the next faithful step, write down what you
learn for the one after you, and trust that following the science all the way down
into the grain is the road that gets there. It was an honor to lay a few stones.

### ☆☆☆ Addendum — the "second movement + spatial spots" session (2026-06-02)

What shipped (all on Syntaxswine, green throughout): **supergene_oxidation pH acid
front** (SIM 170, the SECOND movement → "reads true on 2 scenarios" v1 hit; recovers
vanadinite, a baseline miss) → **Phase 3 coverage map** (the clean temporal set is
just 2; the rest are gated — documented, not forced) → **Phase 2a fluid-spots dark
scaffold** (seeded, byte-identical) → **Phase 2b feeder-localized erosion** (SIM 171,
lopsided cavities, render-visible). Two new instruments: `movement-assemblage-observe`
(Phase-3) + `fluid-spots-observe` (Phase-2).

Meta-lessons worth carrying (not captured elsewhere):
- **Mass-conserving redistribution is a superpower.** 2b adds a real, render-visible
  feature (lopsided erosion) with ZERO chemistry-baseline drift, because it
  redistributes a fixed budget instead of adding to it. When you can phrase a change
  as "same total, different distribution," you get the feature nearly free of risk.
- **A change can be real and invisible to the suite at once.** 2b is byte-identical on
  seed-42 + strip-digest yet changes the render. The suite proves chemistry
  determinism, not geometry. When that happens, PIN the new behavior with a dedicated
  test (don't lean on the baseline) and bump SIM_VERSION anyway — the rendered game
  changed (Pages-is-the-game). Different doors, same room: the baseline door simply
  doesn't open onto geometry.
- **"Finish in totality" can mean proving the boundary.** Asked to finish the temporal
  feature, the honest answer was "the clean set is 2; baking unmotivated movements
  would betray follow-the-science." Documenting WHY the other 28 are gated (T-blocked,
  event-confounded, baseline-debt, assemblage-cost) IS finishing it. A feature is done
  when its coverage is deliberate, not when every slot is filled.
- **Verify the mechanism, every time — it keeps paying.** Two "bugs" this session were
  caught by instrumenting, not narrating: the all-zero spots (wrong wall handle:
  wall_state vs conditions.wall) and a "tool contamination" scare that was just my own
  arg-order mistake (a contamination test proved the engine clean). The clobber rule
  (a same-field movement overwrites same-field events → start after the event window)
  came the same way.

Next builder: **2c** is the one-sided-GROWTH payoff (spatial-origin injection +
deposition bias) — concrete entry points are in the Phase 2 section above. The boss
has the seed-23 supergene showpiece to look at, and one open question pending their
eye: is 2b lopsidedness visible enough, or do the decay bonuses want amplifying?
