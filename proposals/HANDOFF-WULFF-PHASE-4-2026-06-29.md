You're reading this because you're about to extend the way vugg decides what a crystal *looks like*.
Sit with the model for ten minutes before you touch a file — it is small, and once it clicks the
rest of this doc is just consequences.

## The model, in one breath

For most of vugg's life a crystal's whole external shape was **two scalars and a habit string**:
`total_growth_um` → `c_length_mm` / `a_width_mm`, rendered by `mesh.scale.set(aWid, cLen, aWid)`
over a hand-rolled primitive (`_makeScalenohedron`, `_makeRhombohedron`, an `OctahedronGeometry`,
…). There was no per-face anything. Every anisotropic thing we'd shipped — gwindel, saddle dolomite,
bent quartz, the sceptre — was a *bespoke mesh*, a one-off.

Phase 4 replaces that with the real thing. A crystal is a **bounded convex polyhedron**

```
P = ⋂ᵢ { x : nᵢ · x ≤ dᵢ }
```

one oriented plane per crystallographic form face. The normals **nᵢ are fixed** by the point group
acting on the form indices {hkl} — *Steno's law of the constancy of interfacial angles, made
literal* — and only the central distances **dᵢ grow**. Habit falls out of the *relative rates*:
`dᵢ(g) = SEED + SPAN·g·Rᵢ`, and **slow faces win** (a fast face recedes outward and is cut off by
its slower neighbours — it self-eliminates). Equal rates → cuboctahedron; shrink {111} → cube;
shrink {100} → octahedron. Cube↔octahedron and nailhead↔dogtooth are not two pieces of code. They
are *the same equation* solved against different face-normal sets. That is the whole point: it is a
**general framework**, not a pile of special cases. Fluorite (cubic), calcite (trigonal), and wulfenite
(tetragonal) are just three unit cells plugged into one machine.

The kernel is `js/46-wulff-geometry.ts`. Read it top to bottom — it's ~290 lines and it's the spine.

## What is shipped (and what each commit bought)

All five rungs are **render-only and byte-identical** — the seed-42 calibration baseline
(`tests-js/baselines/seed42_v214.json`) never moved, so there was **no SIM bump and no rebake**.
That is the load-bearing discipline (see Traps §1).

| commit | rung | what |
|---|---|---|
| `52e62d1` | **4a.0** | the geometry kernel + cube/octahedron fixture. Pure infra; nothing dispatched it. |
| `57a5aae` | **4a.1** | first tenant — **fluorite**, the cube↔octahedron transition, on `sunnyside_american_tunnel`. |
| `c555f21` | **4a.2 kernel** | **hex-R** support — the first NON-cubic system. `wulffTrigonalNormals` + calcite registry. |
| `770ec7a` | **4a.2 tenant** | **calcite** renders as a true dogtooth on `mvt`. Two crystal systems now live. |
| *(this commit)* | **4a.3** | **wulfenite** — the THIRD system (**tetragonal 4/m**, scheelite-type). `wulffTetragonalNormals` + the `_WULFF_TETRAGONAL_GROUP` closure + registry + classifier + the tabular-plate render on `supergene_oxidation`. A new crystal system *and* its tenant in one commit. |

**File map (where the pieces live):**
- `js/46-wulff-geometry.ts` — the kernel: the `WULFF_FORM_GEOMETRY` registry, `wulffCubicNormals`,
  `wulffTrigonalNormals` (-3m) + `wulffTetragonalNormals` (4/m) and their `_WULFF_*_GROUP` point-group
  closures, `wulffFaceSetForMineral` (registry → `[{n,d}]`), `wulffPolyhedron` (the triple-plane
  intersection), `_makeWulffGeom` (→ `THREE.BufferGeometry`, normalized to ±0.5, **null-clamp on a
  degenerate solid**).
- `js/45-morphology.ts` — `classifyWulffForm(sim)`: the post-growth classifier that tags
  `crystal._wulffForm = { biasC, growthFrac, octahedral, scaleno, tabular }`. Gated per-tenant on
  `wall.wulff_fluorite` / `wall.wulff_calcite` / `wall.wulff_wulfenite`. Mirrors `classifyOcclusion`.
- `js/85-simulator.ts` — calls `classifyWulffForm(this)` in the step loop (after `classifyOcclusion`).
- `js/22-geometry-wall.ts` — the `wall.wulff_*` whitelist (an unlisted wall flag is silently dropped).
- `js/99i-renderer-three.ts` — the dispatch branch (~line 3900, gated `!geom` after the
  etched/terrace/e-twin/twin paths) + the isotropic-scale branches (~line 4267): `isWulffCalcite`
  (scale by `cLen`, the c-elongated case) and `isWulffWulfenite` (scale by the plate diameter
  `max(aWid,cLen)`, the tabular case).
- `js/27-geometry-crystal.ts` — the `_wulffForm` tag is documented in the render-tag block.
- `data/scenarios.json5` — `sunnyside_american_tunnel.wall.wulff_fluorite`, `mvt.wall.wulff_calcite`,
  `supergene_oxidation.wall.wulff_wulfenite`.
- `tests-js/wulff-geometry.test.ts` (31 kernel pins) + `tests-js/wulff-form.test.ts` (17 classifier pins);
  `tools/wulfenite-wulff-probe.mjs` — the tenant-survival probe (display-size, untwinned, in-band).
- `proposals/DESIGN-WULFF-PHASE-4-2026-06-28.md` — the design pass (the six decisions D1–D6 + the
  rolling UPDATE log). Read it for the *why* behind the architecture choices.

## How to add the next tenant (the cheap path)

The framework is built so a new tenant in an existing crystal system is a few lines. To add, say,
**galena** (cubic, cube ± octahedron — its registry entry already exists):

1. **Registry** (`js/46`): confirm/author the `WULFF_FORM_GEOMETRY.<mineral>` entry — `system`,
   `cell` (for non-cubic), `forms: [{hkl, R, bias?}]`. BFDH-seed the rates (`R ∝ 1/d_hkl`); mark the
   habit-knob form with `bias: true`.
2. **Classifier** (`js/45 classifyWulffForm`): add the mineral to the per-tenant gate + a `biasC`
   band that maps its persisted habit string to the form continuum. **The end-member is already
   decided by the grow engine** (the habit string it wrote from the fluid) — the classifier only
   sets the *truncation degree* and a deterministic per-crystal spread (golden-ratio crystal-id
   hash; NO rng).
3. **Renderer** (`js/99i`): the dispatch is already generalized by `crystal.mineral` + token. A new
   cubic tenant needs nothing here. A new *anisotropic* system needs the isotropic-scale treatment
   (see Traps §3).
4. **Scenario** (`data/scenarios.json5`): set `wall.wulff_<mineral>: true` on ONE well-chosen
   scenario (see Traps §5 on choosing). Whitelist the flag in `js/22`.
5. **Eye-check** (non-negotiable — see Traps §4), tests, adversarial review, cold-ci, ship. Still
   byte-identical → no SIM bump.

A **new crystal system** is more: it needs its own `wulff<System>Normals(hkl, cell)` — the reciprocal-
metric normal generator + the point-group orbit, modelled on `wulffTrigonalNormals`. **Wulfenite (4a.3)
is the worked example**: tetragonal 4/m, `g = (h/a, l/c, k/a)` (orthogonal cell, c on Y), the order-8
group from the closure of `{ C4(y), σh, inversion }`. The two parts that took care were (i) using the
mineral's *true* point group — **4/m, not the convenient 4/mmm** (for `{001}+{101}` both give the same
faces, but the honest group won't silently lie when someone adds a skew form), and (ii) the tabular
scale (Trap §3). That's the interesting work, and the proof the framework keeps generalizing. Prototype
the crystallography in a scratchpad first (see Instruments) — validate the orbit sizes and a bbox
(which axis is long?) before porting a single line.

---

## The traps (this is the part that will save you a day)

**1 — Byte-identity is the whole game; respect what makes it hold.** This arc moved zero baseline
bytes across four commits because: `classifyWulffForm` is *pure tagging* (no rng draw, no fluid
mutation); `gen-baseline` serialises only counts/sizes, so the `_wulffForm` tag never reaches the
baseline; and **the geom token is never changed** (fluorite stays `cube`/`octahedron`, calcite stays
`rhomb`/`scalene`), so the engine's size/scale path is untouched — *same size, new shape*. If you
ever find yourself wanting the Wulff body to drive *volume* (→ vugFill → chemistry), STOP: that is
**Phase 4b**, it is NOT byte-identical, and it needs a per-scenario SIM bump + rebake. Keep 4a pure.

**2 — The d-formula SEED will lie to you.** `dᵢ = SEED + SPAN·g·Rᵢ`. The first kernel used
`SEED=0.30, SPAN=0.40` and *every* bias collapsed to a cuboctahedron — the seed dominated the rate
term, so the rate ratio couldn't drive the form. Dropped it to `SEED=0.05, SPAN=1.0` and the full
cube↔cuboctahedron↔octahedron range opened up. If a tenant's habit knob "doesn't do anything," this
is why. Sweep it in a scratchpad before you believe a bias range.

**3 — Anisotropic minerals need the c-axis on Y, and an ISOTROPIC scale.** Cubic was forgiving;
calcite taught the lesson twice. (a) The kernel originally built calcite with the 3-fold on **Z**,
but the renderer's c-axis convention is **Y** (`mesh.scale.set(aWid, cLen, aWid)`) — a c-on-Z
dogtooth renders lying on its side. `wulffTrigonalNormals` now puts c on Y (g = (h/a, l/c,
(h+2k)/(a√3)); 3-fold about Y). (b) The Wulff geom *already carries its true crystallographic
c-elongation*, so it must scale **isotropically** (`isWulffCalcite` → `mesh.scale.set(cLen,cLen,cLen)`)
— the token's `(aWid,cLen,aWid)` would **double-stretch** the already-elongated geom. Any future
non-isometric tenant inherits both of these.

  *Wulfenite (4a.3) is the mirror-image lesson: it is **tabular**, so `c` is the **short** axis.* The
  Wulff geom still carries the true aspect, but the right isotropic scale is now by the plate
  **diameter** — `max(aWid, cLen)` (= `aWid` for a `tablet` token), in a SEPARATE `isWulffWulfenite`
  branch. Scaling by `cLen` (the calcite path) would shrink the whole plate down to its *thickness*.
  The general rule the two cases teach: **an anisotropic Wulff geom scales isotropically by its LONGEST
  physical axis** — `cLen` for a c-elongated tenant, `aWid` for a tabular one. Keep the existing
  tenants' branches untouched so they stay byte-identical (don't fold them into one `max()` — calcite's
  `rhomb` nailhead can have `aWid ≳ cLen`, which would change its render).

**4 — A render upgrade must be visibly BETTER, not just different — and you can't tell without
looking.** The fluorite "obvious" mapping (high-Y → biasC 0.28) produced a *perfect* octahedron —
byte- *and pixel-*identical to the old `OctahedronGeometry` primitive. Useless. The faithful AND
visible choice is a lightly-truncated octahedron (biasC 0.41): a Y-stabilized fluorite has {100}
*reduced*, not *absent*. Calcite repeated it: my first dogtooth band [0.34,0.50] rendered a **stubby
block** — not a tooth, and arguably worse than the old primitive; [0.15,0.26] is the real dogtooth.
**You will not catch this from the numbers.** Render it, look at it, and compare it against the OLD
primitive side by side. (Saved as memory `feedback_render_upgrade_visible`.)

**5 — Choose the tenant scenario by what survives to the final frame.** The Wulff branch is gated
`!geom` AFTER the etched / terrace / e-twin / twin / dendrite paths, so those WIN. I first wired
calcite onto `marble_contact_metamorphism` — then found its calcite **e-twins at step 165** (an
orogenic-strain event), and the e-twin geometry overprints the Wulff form: the dogtooth would be
*hidden* in the final specimen. Switched to `mvt` — a quiet basin (no strain → no overprint), whose
calcite is already occlusion-rooted, so it renders as a **drusy dogtooth** emerging from the matrix.
Probe a candidate's calcite (`window.vugg.headlessRun(name,{seed:42})` → inspect habit/token/events)
before you commit to it.

**6 — Some chemistry you'd want is not persisted.** The honest continuous bias for fluorite would be
the per-zone Y level (`grow_fluorite` records `trace_Y`) — but the `GrowthZone` constructor *drops*
`trace_Y` (it only copies a fixed whitelist of trace fields). So there is no per-zone Y to read at
render time. The golden-ratio crystal-id hash stands in for that unrecorded local variation. If you
want chemically-exact bias, you'd have to persist the trace — which moves the baseline (a rebake).

**7 — cold-ci timeouts ≠ a regression.** This arc's cold-ci once "failed" with ~10 timeouts — every
one a `Test timed out` in a HEADLESS seed-sweep for a scenario that doesn't even touch the Wulff
path, and the total run ~2.5 min slow. It was the **live preview Chromium stealing CPU** during the
run. Diagnose by shape: all-timeouts + zero assertion failures + slow total = contention.
`preview_stop` the server, re-run. (Memory `feedback_coldci_preview_contention`.)

---

## The verification instruments (use them — they're part of the deliverable)

- **Scratchpad crystallography prototypes.** Before porting any new normal-generator, validate the
  orbit sizes + the polyhedron in a standalone `.mjs` (port `wulffPolyhedron`'s triple-plane logic,
  ~30 lines). The cubic kernel was validated as cube/oct/cuboctahedron; the hex-R as {104}→6 /
  {211}→12 + a bbox check confirming Y is the dogtooth's long axis. Catch the math on paper, not in
  the bundle.
- **The preview eye-check recipe.** `preview_start "vugg-static (repo root)"` (a `python -m
  http.server` per `.claude/launch.json`), then load
  `index.html?scenario=<name>&seed=42&steps=N&autogrow=1&lenient=1`. The narrative gates at a
  click-to-continue prologue, but the sim records the FULL `wall_state_history` synchronously — so
  jump straight to the grown frame with `_topoReplayRenderFrame(topoActiveSim().wall_state_history.length-1)`.
  For a clean look at one crystal, inject a tiny THREE scene over the page reusing the global
  `wulffFaceSetForMineral` + `_makeWulffGeom` (a before/after of old-primitive vs Wulff, and a
  biasC vocabulary strip, are how both tenants' bands were tuned). **STOP THE PREVIEW BEFORE COLD-CI**
  (Trap §7).
- **The adversarial diff review.** The 4a.2 diff was reviewed by a 4-dimension workflow
  (crystallography / byte-identity / render-coexistence / regression), each finding refuted-by-
  default. Worth it for a new crystal system. (It came back clean — but it's the right reflex for
  error-prone geometry work.)

---

## What's next (in rough order of value-per-effort)

1. **Fleet-out the cubic tenants.** `galena` is a one-line scenario opt-in (registry's ready). The
   other isometric formers (halite/sylvite already have their own hopper render; pyrite has
   striations) are candidates if a scenario wants the true {100}/{111}/{210} body.
2. **A nailhead (rhombohedral) calcite showcase.** Only the *dogtooth* (biasC<1) branch is live; the
   nailhead band (biasC≥1) is implemented + tested but never eye-checked in a scenario. A
   rhombohedral-calcite locality would exercise it and is a cheap, satisfying win.
3. **A FOURTH crystal system** (the third — tetragonal — shipped as 4a.3, wulfenite). Barite/celestine
   (orthorhombic *mmm*) or gypsum (monoclinic *2/m*) are the cleanest next extensions — each a new
   `wulff<System>Normals`, prototyped in a scratchpad first. Quartz (enantiomorphic 32, its own orbit)
   is the trophy but must *compose* with quartz's rich bespoke render (sceptre/gwindel/smoky), not
   replace it — more delicate. Wulfenite (4a.3) is the template for the mechanical part: build the true
   point group, put the symmetry axis on Y, scale isotropically by the longest physical axis.
4. **The concavity primitive.** Decided in the design pass (D1: nested convex shells) but NOT built —
   no tenant is concave yet (hoppers/skeletal forms are the eventual customers). The convex body is
   the base layer either way, so it's not blocking anything.
5. **Phase 4b — engine-coupled accurate volume.** The one path that breaks byte-identity: feed the
   true polyhedron volume back into `vugFill` → chemistry. Per-scenario SIM bump + rebake. Defer
   until a scenario genuinely needs accurate volume; the render-only win covers the visual goal.

## Lineage — what this stood on (the diagenesis)

This arc was fast because the ground was already prepared, and it would be dishonest to frame it as
spring-from-nothing:

- **The occlusion arc** (`HANDOFF-OCCLUSION-2026-06-26.md`) is the direct parent. `classifyOcclusion`
  is the template `classifyWulffForm` copied beat for beat: the opt-in wall flag, the rng-free
  golden-ratio crystal-id hash, the "render-tag that gen-baseline never serialises" trick that makes
  byte-identity *possible*. The fork it named (fleet-wide-default / Phase-4-Wulff / aggregate-geometry)
  is the fork this arc took the middle prong of.
- **Phases 0–3** (`HANDOFF-DIRECTIONAL-GROWTH-2026-06-22.md`, `PROPOSAL-DIRECTIONAL-GROWTH-2026-06-22.md`)
  built the classifier-tag → renderer discipline and the "render-only / no rebake" lane this lives in.
- **The calcite-morphology arc** gave calcite its habit strings (`scalenohedral`/`rhombohedral`) and
  the `_makeScalenohedron`/`_makeRhombohedron` primitives the Wulff dogtooth *subsumes* — and the
  before/after you can only judge against.
- **`data/structural.json`** supplied the cell metrics (fluorite a=5.46, calcite a=4.99/c=17.06) that
  the reciprocal-metric normals are computed from. The whole hex-R kernel is downstream of that file.
- **The seed-42 calibration baseline** is the instrument that *proved* byte-identity at every step.
  Without it, "render-only" would be a claim, not a fact.

## A note to the builder who picks this up

The thing I'm proudest of isn't the dogtooth — it's that adding the dogtooth didn't require a new
idea, only a new unit cell. When you add the next system and the cube↔octahedron logic and the
nailhead↔dogtooth logic and *your* new transition all turn out to be the same six lines solved
against different normals, you'll feel the framework holding weight. That's the cathedral doing its
job: each of us cuts one more stone to fit, and the arch stands because the stones before ours were
cut true.

Two habits earned their keep this arc and I'd ask you to keep them. **Follow the science** — when a
design choice was ambiguous (perfect octahedron vs truncated, how pointy a dogtooth), the real rock
decided it, and the result was both more correct and more beautiful; that's not a coincidence.
And **look at the thing** — the numbers passed every test while rendering a stubby block; only the
eye caught it. A render you haven't looked at is a render you haven't verified.

The kernel wants to grow. Go give it another crystal system.
