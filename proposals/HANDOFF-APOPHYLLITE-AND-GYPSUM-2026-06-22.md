# HANDOFF — green apophyllite (shipped) + hourglass gypsum (queued) — 2026-06-22

Part of the crystal-face-realism arc (master doc
`PROPOSALS-crystal-face-realism-2026-06-21.md`; the arc's running record is the
`project_vugg_crystal_face_realism` memory). This session shipped STEP 3 and queued
STEP 4. It is also, honestly, a session about being **wrong productively** — read the
cross-check trail below before the gypsum plan, because the *method* is the deliverable
as much as the mineral.

## What shipped — GREEN APOPHYLLITE

Two commits, both pushed to Syntaxswine origin and **Pages-verified at HEAD**:

- **`1710ac0` — SIM 210.** Apophyllite gains the prized Poona/Pune green: a V⁴⁺
  COLOUR DISPATCHER in `grow_apophyllite` (js/59, `fluid.V>0.5` → `_apophylliteGreen`,
  never a growth gate — the §4b pattern), tagged by `classifySectorZoning` (js/45)
  kind `'apophyllite_green'`, rendered by `js/99i _makeApophyllitePrism`.
  `deccan_zeolite` gained a modest V=3 trace. Baseline: deccan 60→59 crystals,
  species 17→17 (one marginal nucleation flipped by V's ionic-strength contribution;
  no V-mineral fires), all 35 other scenarios byte-identical.
- **`45ca65c` — SIM-neutral fix.** The render corrected to **UNIFORM green** (see
  the corpus finding below). Render colour + framing only; baseline untouched.

The arc set out to add a *visible-hourglass sector tenant*. The honest outcome:
apophyllite is **not** one. It is a uniform-green colour variety whose sector zoning
is real but **optical-only**. That's not a failure — it's the science telling us the
truth, and it pointed us at the mineral that *does* have a visible hourglass (gypsum).

## The cross-check trail — three corrections, an error caught at each

The boss set the discipline: *when an independent research pass and my own work
disagree, the disagreement is a blind-spot detector — verify it, don't pick a side.*
This session was a clean demonstration. In order:

1. **Chromophore (the handoff was wrong).** A boss research handoff
   (`StonePhilosopher/vugg-handoffs/apophyllite-sector-zoning.md`) said the green is
   **Cu**. The locality-specific peer source — Rossman 1974, *"Optical Spectroscopy
   of Green **Vanadium** Apophyllite from Poona"*, Am.Min. 59(5-6):621-622, VERIFIED
   to the Caltech/MSA archive — says **V⁴⁺** (~1600 ppm). No source supports Cu for
   Poona. The "Cu" was a research-agent confabulation (Cu = the "obvious" green
   chromophore by analogy to dioptase/malachite). **Built with V.**

2. **Framing (I was wrong).** I had called apophyllite "not real sector zoning, just
   dichroism." Wrong. Apophyllite is a **classic anomalous-birefringence mineral** —
   its optic sign varies *within a single crystal* because the growth faces trap
   different amounts of structural water and F/OH. That is genuine growth-sector
   zoning. The handoff had this right and I had under-called it.

3. **Visible colour (the first render was wrong).** This is the one the boss's *next*
   idea caught. Both the handoff and I had assumed the V⁴⁺ green is *partitioned by
   sector* (handoff: prism sectors; my Phase A render: green prism / pale basal
   "waist"). The boss asked: if the literature doesn't pin which sector carries the
   colour, can we **gather the data** — scour the web for provenance-known specimen
   images and read it off real crystals? We did (see method). The verdict: the green
   is a **uniform body colour**, no visible prism-vs-pyramid partition at all. The
   sector zoning from (2) is microscope-only; it does not show as visible colour.
   Corrected the render to uniform green + a pearly {001} basal-face luster.

Net: the famous green mineral's "sector zoning" is invisible to the eye. We render
what the eye sees (uniform green), and document the rest honestly.

---

## The image-corpus method (reusable — capture this)

When the literature won't pin a **visual** detail (which sector carries colour, a
luster contrast, a habit proportion), build a provenance-locked image corpus and read
it off real specimens. The recipe that worked:

1. **A research agent assembles direct image URLs** with per-specimen provenance.
   Mindat is bot-walled (returns a JS stub to `curl`) — it gives page URLs only;
   **iRocks/Arkenstone, FossilEra, Astro Gallery, minfind** serve direct JPGs.
2. **`curl` them to a temp dir** (`.tmp-*`, with a browser User-Agent). **NEVER
   commit the images** — they're transient observation aids; cite the source URLs.
3. **VIEW them yourself with Read** (the visual judgment is yours, not the agent's —
   the agent's text *descriptions* were directionally right here, but you must look).
4. **Filter HARD by provenance** (Pune/Maharashtra only — other-locality green may
   have a different chromophore/habit) and **weight consistency across independent
   sources** (4 specimens agreeing is signal; dealer lighting/white-balance/saturation
   is noise).
5. **Report the pattern even when it contradicts what you shipped.** That's the point.

Composes with `build-tools-to-verify` and `cross-check-research-disagreements`.

## NEXT — hourglass GYPSUM (selenite): the real visible-sector tenant

The arc still wants a vug-native *visible* hourglass. Gypsum is it. The boss
confirmed firsthand (and the literature agrees): clay/anhydrite-inclusion **growth
sectors** give a genuine visible hourglass — the classic "hourglass selenite."

**Design envelope (from the boss — treat as both spec and design hint):**
- The hourglass is **genuinely visible**, sometimes even in a nearly water-clear
  crystal.
- It is **variable — not on every specimen.** So model it as a **variant**, not a
  universal habit: a spectrum from *clear-with-a-visible-inclusion-hourglass* ↔
  *inclusion-flooded* where later **overgrowth floods the crystal to solid brown**
  and the hourglass is lost. Render both ends.
- The mechanism is **mechanical inclusion of fine sediment/clay swept into the
  fast-growing sectors** (not a trace-element colour partition like the chiastolite
  carbon — though the geometry rhymes; the chiastolite-cross machinery in
  `_makeChiastolitePrism` is the closest render precedent, and the sector-zoning
  registry in js/45 is the home).

**Suggested shape of the sub-arc (preflight first):**
1. **Preflight grep** — gypsum/selenite is almost certainly already in `minerals.json`
   (it appears in evaporite scenarios; `selenite` is referenced). Confirm what exists
   before designing. This is likely a *habit-variant + render + scenario* job, not a
   new mineral (the apophyllite shape).
2. **Research-first**, citations to publisher pages — the inclusion-hourglass
   mechanism, the localities (the classic clay-included "hourglass selenite" of the
   US Great Plains / sabkha settings), and whether a real specimen's hourglass is
   {hkl}-sector or a {010}-cleavage-plane phenomenon. Then **image-corpus it** (the
   method above) to nail the *visible* geometry before rendering — same discipline
   that corrected apophyllite.
3. **The variant axis** is the interesting engine question: tie the
   clear↔flooded-brown spectrum to an inclusion-load driver (suspended-sediment /
   turbidity in the broth, or growth rate). A scenario where early fast growth traps
   clay (hourglass) and late slow clear growth overgrows it (the boss's "totally
   brown" via overgrowth) would tell the whole story in one crystal.
4. Render + narrator + tests + (if chemistry moves) SIM bump + rebake; else
   SIM-neutral like the tourmaline/apophyllite render tenants.

**Do it in a fresh session** — this one ran very long; gypsum deserves clean context.

## Tree state + traps tripped (so the next builder doesn't)

- **HEAD `45ca65c`**, Pages built at HEAD, SIM_VERSION 210, full CI green
  (2013 tests; one **confirmed-flaky** test, `pharmacolite.test.ts` "at least one
  crystal appears across the seed sample" — a 32-seed statistical assertion that
  fails under heavy load and passes on isolated re-run; it is NOT a chemistry
  regression). `tools/strip-story-diff.mjs` remains a concurrent session's untracked
  WIP — **leave it.**
- **`npm run ci | tail` masks the exit code.** Twice this session a CI run reported
  "exit 0" that was actually `tail`'s exit, not npm's — the chain had aborted at
  `build:check`. **Capture the real code** (`npm run ci > log 2>&1; echo "EXIT=$?"`)
  and grep the log for the test summary; don't trust a piped exit.
- **A manual `node tools/build.mjs` builds from STALE compiled TS** (it doesn't run
  tsc first), so `build:check` (which runs a fresh tsc) then sees index.html out of
  date. **Use `npm run build`** (tsc → build) to regenerate, then `build:check` is
  clean. This bit the apophyllite-fix CI once.
- **Render is the one thing CI can't catch** (jsdom, no WebGL). The temp-debug
  standalone-scene injection (THREE global, r163; inline the geom builder, screenshot)
  is the way — it caught both the multiplier-vs-absolute lesson (Phase A) and
  confirmed the uniform-green correction.

## A maker's mark

I want to mark what this session actually was, because it isn't what it looks like in
the commit log. The commit log says: added a mineral, then fixed its render. What
actually happened is that I was **wrong four times** — augite was the wrong mineral
(it breaks the cavity premise), "not real sector zoning" was the wrong framing, "Cu"
was the wrong chromophore (inherited, but I'd have shipped it), and the two-tone
render was the wrong picture — and the work got *better* at every one of those
turns. That is the thing I'd ask the next builder to protect.

Because the temptation, especially when you can move fast, is to be right the first
time — to reason your way to the answer and ship it clean. This session is a standing
argument against that. I could not have reasoned my way to "the green is uniform." I
*believed* it was sector-partitioned; the boss believed it; the famous-mineral
folklore half-believes it. The only thing that knew better was four photographs of
real crystals sitting on real stilbite. We went and looked, and the rocks corrected
all of us at once. **The specimen is the authority. Not the model, not the handoff,
not the confident agent — the specimen.** Build the machinery that lets a specimen
overrule you quickly and without it costing your ego anything, and you will ship true
things. Skip that machinery and you will ship confident things, which is worse,
because confident-and-wrong survives review.

The boss gave me the sharpest tool for this, and I want to name it so it doesn't get
lost as a one-off: **a disagreement is not a problem to resolve, it's a blind spot
announcing itself.** When the research pass and I diverged, the instinct is to decide
who's right. The better move is to treat the divergence as a pin dropped on the map
that says *dig here* — and dig with a method (web-verify the citation; gather the
image corpus) rather than an opinion. Every time we did that this session, it paid:
it caught a confabulated chromophore, an under-called mechanism, and a wrong render,
each of which had quietly passed as "fine." Two minds that agree have one blind spot;
two that disagree have a flashlight. Keep the disagreements. Don't smooth them.

And the small honest thing, the one I'm actually proud of: when the corpus contradicted
the render I had *already shipped and deployed an hour earlier*, the right move was to
tear it back to uniform green and say so plainly in the commit — "the first-shipped
two-tone imposed a colour sector that real crystals don't have." A preserved wart is
not a win. Shipping fast only earns its keep if you're willing to un-ship just as fast
when a rock tells you you were wrong.

Gypsum is the reward for all of it: a mineral whose hourglass you can actually *see* —
and even there, the boss already knows the trap (it's variable, the brown ones are
overgrown). So when you build it: look at the specimens first. They're waiting to
tell you something you don't yet believe.

— the builder, signing off this step. Go look at the rocks.
