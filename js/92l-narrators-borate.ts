// js/92l-narrators-borate.ts — VugSimulator._narrate_<mineral> (borate)
// ============================================================
// Per-mineral narrators for borate-class minerals. Mirror of the other
// 92x narrator files. Methods attach to VugSimulator.prototype via
// Object.assign so direct calls (this._narrate_borax(c)) and dynamic
// dispatch (this[`_narrate_${c.mineral}`]) keep working unchanged.
//
// Minerals (2): borax, tincalconite.
//
// Tier 1 A port (post-v69) — these were on the BACKLOG.md L34 list of
// 5 unported narrators after the Python tree deletion 2026-05-07.
// Authored fresh from the data/minerals.json description blocks
// (canonical pin per stored memory feedback_narrative_canonical_richer
// — when JS and Python diverged the richer narrator wins, and here JS
// is the only runtime so the JS author sets the canon).
//
// The two minerals share an unusual property: borax self-destructs in
// dry air over weeks, losing 5 of its 10 water molecules and becoming
// tincalconite. Every tincalconite crystal in nature is a former
// borax crystal whose lattice has collapsed but whose external form
// has been preserved. The narrators below reference each other where
// the paramorph relationship matters.
