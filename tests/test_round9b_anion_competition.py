"""Round 9b regression — anion-competition mechanic.

The 3-branch generalization of 9a's broth-ratio gate. Three uranyl
minerals compete for the same U⁶⁺ cation, differentiated by which
anion dominates the local fluid:

  torbernite   Cu(UO₂)₂(PO₄)₂·12H₂O    P/(P+As) > 0.5   (9b)
  zeunerite    Cu(UO₂)₂(AsO₄)₂·xH₂O    As/(P+As) > 0.5  (9b)
  carnotite    K₂(UO₂)₂(VO₄)₂·3H₂O     V branch         (9c — deferred)

These tests exercise 9b's two branches via synthetic VugConditions
independent of any scenario, so the mechanic is verified even when
no shipped scenario has the U + Cu + (P or As) conjunction at
supergene T.

When a "Schneeberg-style oxidized U-pegmatite" scenario lands,
torbernite/zeunerite will nucleate naturally; until then this file
is the canonical proof the engines work.

    Defaults pass every non-anion-fraction gate for both torbernite

    Ca=5 default is the **9d cation-fork context** — these regression

    FluidChemistry Ca is 200 ppm (groundwater background); explicitly
    setting Ca=5 puts us in mining-district context where torbernite
