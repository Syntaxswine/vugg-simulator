# Bug Report: deccan_zeolite scenario doesn't fire apophyllite (its namesake mineral)

**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Surfaced by:** v18 scenario species-expectation work (commit `2d977fa`)
**Severity:** Scenario fails its design intent — anchor mineral never nucleates

---

## Summary

The `deccan_zeolite` scenario is anchored to the Nashik "bloody apophyllite" type expression and explicitly named for apophyllite (`Deccan Apophyllite Vesicle`). Its `description` promises "pseudo-cubic apophyllite" and its event timeline includes a dedicated `apophyllite_stage_iii` event. But at seed-42 (and likely many other seeds), apophyllite **never nucleates**.

Currently fires (v17, seed-42):
```
['albite', 'goethite', 'hematite', 'magnetite', 'quartz', 'siderite']
```

Should fire:
```
[..., 'apophyllite']  ← the namesake of the entire scenario
```

## Root cause: SiO2 depleted below apophyllite gate before Stage III event

`supersaturation_apophyllite` (vugg.py:1732) requires `SiO2 >= 800` among its hard gates. The deccan_zeolite scenario starts with SiO2=900 and adds:
- Stage I (step 20): SiO2 += 400 → 1300
- Stage II (step 70): SiO2 += 200 → 1500 (cumulative)
- Stage III (step 110): SiO2 += 300 → expected 1800

But background quartz growth (which uses the Fournier & Potter 1982 silica_equilibrium table since v17, much more accurate than the pre-v17 `50*exp(0.008*T)` formula) depletes SiO2 aggressively. Actual trajectory at seed-42:

```
step=  0   T=248  K=2   Ca=180  SiO2=900   F=1   σ_apo=0  (K, F below gates)
step= 20   T=197  K=2   Ca=180  SiO2=1266  F=1   σ_apo=0  (after silica veneer; K,F still below gates)
step= 70   T=128  K=12  Ca=260  SiO2=756   F=1   σ_apo=0  (after Stage II; F still below)
step=110   T=147  K=37  Ca=310  SiO2=472   F=5   σ_apo=0  (after Stage III; SiO2 BELOW 800 GATE)
step=199   T=25   K=37  Ca=310  SiO2=10    F=5   σ_apo=0  (final state — SiO2 fully depleted)
```

**The K + F + pH + T gates all pass after Stage III. But SiO2 has already been pulled down to 472 ppm by quartz, well below the 800 ppm apophyllite requires.** Stage III's +300 SiO2 pulse only brings it to ~772 — still under the gate.

Pre-v17, Python's quartz supersat used `50 * exp(0.008*T)` which overestimated equilibrium SiO2 by ~3x at high T. Quartz didn't fire as aggressively, SiO2 stayed elevated, apophyllite could nucleate after Stage III. The v17 silica correction (Fournier & Potter 1982 / Rimstidt 1997 tabulated solubility) is geologically correct but exposed this scenario's quiet dependency on the wrong formula.

## Fix options

### Option A (cleanest): bump Stage III SiO2 pulse

In `event_deccan_zeolite_apophyllite_stage_iii` (vugg.py:12009 + index.html mirror):
```python
conditions.fluid.SiO2 += 300  # → bump to 600 or 800
```
Bumping to +600 lands SiO2 at ~1072 after the event, with 270+ ppm of headroom above the 800 gate. Apophyllite gets time to nucleate before background quartz consumption pulls it back below the gate.

### Option B: bump initial SiO2 in scenario JSON

`data/scenarios.json5` deccan_zeolite initial fluid:
```json5
"SiO2": 900,  // → 1500
```
More generous starting silica means less risk of getting depleted. But this changes Stage I behavior too (more silica veneer / chalcedony).

### Option C: lower apophyllite's SiO2 gate

The 800 ppm threshold is research-backed (apophyllite is silica-rich, 8 SiO₂ per formula unit). Lowering to ~500 might let apophyllite fire here but would also let it fire in scenarios where it shouldn't. **Not recommended.**

**Recommended:** Option A. Surgical, fixes the design intent, doesn't perturb other stages or other scenarios.

## Verification after fix

Run the scenario at seed-42 and check apophyllite count > 0:
```bash
python -c "
import random, vugg
random.seed(42)
result = vugg.SCENARIOS['deccan_zeolite']()
sim = vugg.VugSimulator(result[0], result[1])
for _ in range(result[2]): sim.run_step()
print('apophyllite:', sum(1 for c in sim.crystals if c.mineral == 'apophyllite'))
"
```

Then add `apophyllite` to `expects_species` in `data/scenarios.json5`:
```json5
"expects_species": ["hematite", "quartz", "magnetite", "apophyllite"],
```

Then `tests/test_scenario_expectations.py::test_scenario_fires_expected_species[deccan_zeolite]` will codify the fix and prevent future regression.

## Related: the "bloody apophyllite" phantom inclusion mechanic

The scenario is also designed for hematite-needle phantoms inside apophyllite (the Nashik diagnostic). The hematite needles fire correctly (1 hematite, 1 magnetite at seed-42), but with no apophyllite forming there's nothing to host the phantoms. Fixing apophyllite nucleation is prerequisite to the phantom mechanic having anything to attach to.

## Priority

Medium. The scenario is shipped and labeled as a feature, but its anchor mineral never appears — geologists or players running deccan_zeolite expecting apophyllite will be surprised. Fix is small (one number change in two runtimes) and the test infrastructure to catch any regression is already in place.

## Why this surfaced now

Pre-v17, Python's silica_equilibrium overshoot kept SiO2 elevated, masking the fact that the Stage III pulse was undersized relative to the apophyllite gate. The v17 silica reconciliation made quartz consumption physically realistic, which exposed the gap. This is the correct order of operations: fix the physics first, then surface the scenario-design bugs the wrong physics was hiding.
