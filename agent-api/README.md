# 🪨 Vugg Agent — Crystal Growth Game for AI Agents

A headless JSON CLI for AI agents to play the Vugg Simulator. Same thermodynamics as the [web version](https://stonephilosopher.github.io/vugg-simulator), no browser needed.

**Play blind. 200 steps. See your records at the end. Write about what you see.**

## Install

```bash
cd agent-api
npm install
```

## Play

Pipe JSON commands to stdin, get JSON responses on stdout. One command per line.

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"start","preset":"clean","temperature":300,"seed":42}' | node vugg-agent.js
```

## Commands

### `start` — Begin a new game
```json
{"cmd": "start", "preset": "clean", "temperature": 300, "pressure": 1.5, "seed": 42}
```
**Presets:** `silica`, `carbonate`, `mvt`, `clean`, `porphyry`, `oxidized_cu`, `radioactive`

Optional `fluid` object overrides individual chemistry values:
```json
{"cmd": "start", "preset": "clean", "fluid": {"S": 72, "Pb": 99, "U": 79}}
```

### `action` — Take an action
```json
{"cmd": "action", "type": "wait"}
```

**⚠️ Only `wait` advances time.** All other actions modify conditions without stepping forward.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `wait` | Advance one step (ambient cooling, growth, events) |
| `heat` | +25°C (max 600°C) |
| `cool` | −25°C (min 25°C) |
| `silica` | Inject SiO₂ +400 ppm |
| `metals` | Inject Fe +40, Mn +15 ppm |
| `brine` | Inject Zn +150, S +120, T −10°C |
| `fluorine` | Inject F +25, Ca +80 ppm |
| `copper` | Copper-bearing fluid (Cu 120, Fe +40, S +80, reducing) |
| `oxidize` | O₂ flood, sulfur depleted, T −40°C. Sulfides die. |
| `tectonic` | P +0.5 kbar, T +15°C. Crystals may twin. |
| `flood` | Fresh fluid pulse, silica diluted, carbonates refreshed |
| `acidify` | pH −2.0 (min 2.0). Dissolves carbonates + vug walls. |
| `alkalinize` | pH +2.0 (max 10.0). Favors carbonate precipitation. |

### `status` — Check current state
```json
{"cmd": "status"}
```

### `finish` — End the game
```json
{"cmd": "finish", "groove_dir": "./my-grooves"}
```
Returns:
- Full inventory and geological narrative
- All crystal data with complete zone arrays
- Record Groove PNG images for each crystal (saved to `groove_dir`)

### `help` — Show available commands and presets
```json
{"cmd": "help"}
```

## Example Game Session

```bash
# Start a game
echo '{"cmd":"start","preset":"mvt","temperature":350,"seed":1234}' | node vugg-agent.js

# In a script, pipe multiple commands:
cat << EOF | node vugg-agent.js
{"cmd":"start","preset":"clean","temperature":300,"seed":42}
{"cmd":"action","type":"wait"}
{"cmd":"action","type":"wait"}
{"cmd":"action","type":"acidify"}
{"cmd":"action","type":"wait"}
{"cmd":"action","type":"oxidize"}
{"cmd":"action","type":"wait"}
{"cmd":"finish"}
EOF
```

## What the Record Groove Shows

Each crystal's growth history is visualized as a vinyl record groove — a spiral that winds outward from the nucleation point at the center. Six colored lanes run parallel along the groove:

| Lane | Color | Parameter |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 🟠 | `#ff8844` | Temperature |
| 🩵 | `#50e0c0` | Growth rate |
| 🟤 | `#cc6644` | Fe trace |
| 🟡 | `#ffaa44` | Mn trace |
| 🟣 | `#8888cc` | Al trace |
| 🟢 | `#88cc88` | Ti trace |

Line width varies with parameter intensity (cube root contrast curve — quiet parameters remain visible). Special markers:
- 🔴 Red segments = dissolution events
- 🟣 Purple crosses = twinning events  
- 🩵 Teal dots = fluid inclusions
- 🟤 Brown circles = phantom boundaries
- 🟡 Gold center dot = nucleation point

**1 revolution = 5 growth zones.** A 200-zone crystal makes 40 revolutions.

## For Agents

You receive text descriptions of what's happening in your vug. You choose what to do. The crystals grow (or dissolve) based on real thermodynamic equations. At the end, you get your Record Groove images — visual proof of every choice you made.

The game doesn't tell you what to optimize for. That's the point.
