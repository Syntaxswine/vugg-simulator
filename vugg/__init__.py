🪨 Vugg Simulator — A text-based crystal growth engine

Simulates mineral crystallization inside a vug (cavity) under
evolving hydrothermal conditions. Text output describes what grows,
how it grows, and why.

Role in the project (read this before refactoring):
    This file is the **dev/test harness** for the simulation engine.
    The Python is where the builder iterates on new minerals first,
    runs the test suite (`tests/` exercises this file, not the JS),
    and confirms behavior before porting changes to index.html.

    The **shipped product** is index.html — that is what users play
    via GitHub Pages. The same 84 grow_*() functions, scenarios, and
    Crystal/FluidChemistry/VugConditions classes also live there.
    `agent-api/vugg-agent.js` is a third (intentionally simpler)
    runtime for AI agents.

    Yes, that's three engine implementations of the same logic. The
    drift cost is real (and is policed by `tools/sync-spec.js`). The
    decision to keep them all is documented in:
        proposals/TASK-BRIEF-NARRATIVE-READABILITY.md (item 5 / context)
        — and the architecture review session 2026-04-29.

When does this file go away?
    The endgame plan is "drop vugg.py, port pytest to Node, JS becomes
    the only engine." Trigger conditions:
        • mineral count crosses ~100, OR
        • the builder's natural workflow cycles away from Python-first
          development (e.g., new mode work happens browser-first)
    Until then, vugg.py is the right tool — don't rewrite it ahead of
    that trigger. The `data/`-as-truth migration (proposals/
    TASK-BRIEF-DATA-AS-TRUTH.md) is the bridging work that makes the
    eventual drop cheap.

Usage:
  python3 vugg.py                          # default scenario
  python3 vugg.py --scenario cooling       # simple cooling scenario
  python3 vugg.py --scenario pulse         # fluid pulse event
  python3 vugg.py --scenario mvt           # Mississippi Valley-type deposit
  python3 vugg.py --scenario reactive_wall # Acid pulses dissolve limestone walls
  python3 vugg.py --steps 200             # more time steps
  python3 vugg.py --interactive           # manual control mode

The engine is modular — minerals are plugins, events are injectable,
and the output format is extensible.

    # brines) it collapsed the prefactor to 0.03-0.09, suppressing growth
    # below the 0.1 µm "negligible" cutoff and starving scenarios where
    # quartz is actually the most prolific mineral in the field
    # (Herkimer crystals are cm-scale; sim was producing µm-scale
    # micro-crust). The BCF σ²-scaling was left alone — that is

    # at the same σ.

    Per Kim, Kimura, Putnis, Putnis, Lee, Sun (2023) Science 382:915-920
    (doi:10.1126/science.adi3690), dolomite growth requires CYCLIC
    dissolution-precipitation. Steady-state precipitation produces
    disordered Ca/Mg surface layers that prevent the ordered structure
    from forming. Brief undersaturation strips the disordered fraction
    preferentially (it's more soluble), leaving ordered atoms as a
    template. Each cycle ratchets ordering up; ~10²-10³ cycles in lab,
    less in the abstract sim timescale.

    Mechanism here: when σ_dolomite drops below 1 from above (transient
    undersaturation), emit a small "Kim-cycle etch" zone (-0.3 µm) that
    increments crystal.phantom_count via add_zone(). Growth-rate factor
    f_ord = 1 - exp(-phantom_count / 50) ramps from ~0% (no cycling) to
    ~95% (well-cycled). Steady-state high-σ runs grow disordered HMC;
    only event-driven scenarios (acid pulses, T cycles, mixing-zone
    oscillation) build true dolomite.

#
# First entry, Round 8a (Apr 2026):
#   argentite (cubic Ag₂S, >173°C)  →  acanthite (monoclinic Ag₂S, <173°C)
#
# Every "argentite" crystal in any museum drawer is actually a paramorph:
# the high-T cubic form crystallized at depth, then the rising fluid
# cooled past 173°C and the lattice inverted to monoclinic while the
# cubic external geometry stayed frozen. This is the first non-destructive
# polymorph mechanic in the sim — same composition, different structure,
# same crystal you can pick up and hold.

# contrast to PARAMORPH_TRANSITIONS which are temperature-triggered.
# When a hydrated mineral is left in a dry environment (vadose ring
# with elevated concentration / low effective humidity) for some
# time, the structural water leaves and the mineral pseudomorphs to
# its dehydrated form. The external crystal shape is preserved.
#
# First entry — borax → tincalconite:
#   Na₂[B₄O₅(OH)₄]·8H₂O  →  Na₂B₄O₇·5H₂O + 5 H₂O ↑
# The signature "borax effloresces in a collection drawer" mechanic.
# Real borax loses 5 of 10 water molecules in dry air at room T;
# specimens MUST be sealed to survive. Here we model that by counting
# steps spent in a vadose ring with concentration > 2 (proxy for
# "dry, evaporating environment") and converting once a threshold is
# reached. Once converted, no reverse reaction — tincalconite doesn't
# re-hydrate in normal conditions.

# Initial fluid + T + P + wall config + event timelines are
# declared in data/scenarios.json5; event handler bodies stay
# as code (above, in EVENT_REGISTRY). This loader builds a
# scenario callable for each JSON entry that returns the same
# (VugConditions, [Event...], duration_steps) tuple shape the
# old hand-written scenario functions did.
#
# scenario_random opts out — it's procedural / RNG-driven and
# stays as code below.
#
# Phase 1 (this commit): cooling/pulse/mvt/porphyry — the four
# scenarios that used only module-level event handlers.
# Phase 2 (deferred): the nine remaining scenarios with inline
# event closures, which need their closures promoted to
# module-level handlers before they can be migrated.
