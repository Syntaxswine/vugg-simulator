# Vugg Simulator — Architecture Pointer

**This file is intentionally short.** Earlier versions tried to inventory minerals,
scenarios, modes, and code line-ranges; that content drifted faster than anyone
could maintain it (see commit history of this file). It now points at the
canonical source for each kind of fact instead.

If a section below is wrong, update the canonical source — not this file.

| Module index (JS source)       | `js/README.md` — every prefix annotated, "find X by purpose" |
| Modes shown to the player      | the title screen — open `index.html` and look       |

## Two runtimes, on purpose

The simulation engine ships in two places, both JavaScript:

- **`index.html`** — the shipped product, **generated** by the build
  pipeline (see "Build pipeline" below). GitHub Pages serves repo root.
  Edit source files under `js/`, not `index.html` directly.
- **`agent-api/vugg-agent.js`** — headless CLI for AI agents. Intentionally
  simpler. Read the top-of-file comment for what "intentionally simpler"
  means and how its lag relative to the in-browser bundle is policed.

The bundle is the source of truth for chemistry; the agent CLI mirrors
selected engines for the headless-play surface.

History: there was a third runtime — a Python `vugg/` package and
`tests/` pytest suite that the builder iterated against first, with
`tools/sync-spec.js` as the cross-runtime drift detector. The Python
side was retired (2026-05-07) once the JS test surface (`tests-js/`,
vitest) covered the same regressions; the cross-runtime drift checker
retired with it. Older clones still carry the Python tree — see git
history for `vugg/`, `tests/`, `pytest.ini`, `tools/sync-spec.js`,
`tools/supersat_drift_audit.py`, `tools/twin_rate_check.py`,
`tools/check-minerals-diff.py`, `tools/new-mineral.py`. Some legacy
JS comments still cite "mirrors X in vugg.py" — these are fossil
references and can be cleaned up incrementally; the JS itself is now
the source of truth.

## Build pipeline

`index.html` is **generated** from `js/**/*.ts`. The build is a tiny
TypeScript compile + concatenation, no bundler or framework.

```
npm install              # once — pulls in TypeScript as a devDependency
npm run build            # tsc + splice → updates index.html in place
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit; CI guard for type regressions
npm run build:check      # exits 1 if index.html is out-of-date
npm run ci               # typecheck + build:check (combined regression guard)
```

Internals: `tools/build-all.mjs` runs `tsc -p tsconfig.json` (which emits
`dist/**/*.js`), then `tools/build.mjs` walks `dist/` in lex order,
concatenates with file-marker headers, and splices the result into
`index.html` between BUILD markers inside the inline `<script>`. The
markers (`// === BUILD:bundle:start ===` / `…end ===`) live in the HTML;
do not remove them.

**Adding a new module:** drop a `.ts` file under `js/` with a numeric
prefix that puts it in the right load order (everything is one big
script after concatenation, so file order = top-of-file load order).
Top-level `let`/`const` evaluation is order-sensitive; `function`
declarations are hoisted bundle-wide.

**Adding a new mineral** is now ≤4 file touches:
1. `data/minerals.json` (the spec)
2. `js/3x-supersat-<class>.ts` (the supersat method)
3. `js/5x-engines-<class>.ts` (the grow function)
4. `js/65-mineral-engines.ts` (the registry entry)

Plus optionally a narrator (`js/92x-narrators-<class>.ts`) and a
nucleation gate (`js/8x-nucleation-<class>.ts`) if the mineral wants
them.

### History note: web/ → root flatten (2026-04-29)

This used to be a `web/index.html` source plus a curated `docs/` mirror that
GitHub Pages served. The mirror was retired in favor of root-served Pages —
single layout, no per-commit `cp web/index.html docs/index.html` ritual.
**Pages source folder must be set to `/(root)`** for the live site to work
after this change.

## What goes in this file going forward

- Pointers (you are reading them).
- Cross-cutting decisions that don't fit anywhere else (e.g., the
  two-runtimes-on-purpose framing above).
- Layout maps when something non-obvious moves.

What does NOT go here:
- Mineral / scenario / mode counts. These belong to the canonical source.
- Code line-range maps. They drift in days.
- Roadmap. That's `BACKLOG.md`.
