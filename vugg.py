🪨 Vugg Simulator — A text-based crystal growth engine

Simulates mineral crystallization inside a vug (cavity) under
evolving hydrothermal conditions. Text output describes what grows,
how it grows, and why.

Role in the project (read this before refactoring):
    This file is the **dev/test harness** for the simulation engine.
    The Python is where the builder iterates on new minerals first,
    runs the test suite (`tests/` exercises this file, not the JS),
    and confirms behavior before porting changes to index.html.

    The **shipped product** is index.html — that is what users play
    via GitHub Pages. The same 84 grow_*() functions, scenarios, and
    Crystal/FluidChemistry/VugConditions classes also live there.
    `agent-api/vugg-agent.js` is a third (intentionally simpler)
    runtime for AI agents.

    Yes, that's three engine implementations of the same logic. The
    drift cost is real (and is policed by `tools/sync-spec.js`). The
    decision to keep them all is documented in:
        proposals/TASK-BRIEF-NARRATIVE-READABILITY.md (item 5 / context)
        — and the architecture review session 2026-04-29.

When does this file go away?
    The endgame plan is "drop vugg.py, port pytest to Node, JS becomes
    the only engine." Trigger conditions:
        • mineral count crosses ~100, OR
        • the builder's natural workflow cycles away from Python-first
          development (e.g., new mode work happens browser-first)
    Until then, vugg.py is the right tool — don't rewrite it ahead of
    that trigger. The `data/`-as-truth migration (proposals/
    TASK-BRIEF-DATA-AS-TRUTH.md) is the bridging work that makes the
    eventual drop cheap.

Usage:
  python3 vugg.py                          # default scenario
  python3 vugg.py --scenario cooling       # simple cooling scenario
  python3 vugg.py --scenario pulse         # fluid pulse event
  python3 vugg.py --scenario mvt           # Mississippi Valley-type deposit
  python3 vugg.py --scenario reactive_wall # Acid pulses dissolve limestone walls
  python3 vugg.py --steps 200             # more time steps
  python3 vugg.py --interactive           # manual control mode

The engine is modular — minerals are plugins, events are injectable,
and the output format is extensible.

# ============================================================
# SIM VERSION
# ============================================================
# Monotonic version tag bumped by any change that could shift seed-42
# output for any scenario (chemistry retune, engine change, new mineral,
# new event, new mechanic). Used by the scenario-chemistry audit and
# later by the multi-ring 3D simulation (see PROPOSAL-3D-SIMULATION.md)
# to distinguish v1 (pre-audit) from v2 (post-audit) output streams.
#
#   v1 — pre-audit: generic FluidChemistry defaults, Mg=0 in most scenarios
#   v2 — scenario-chemistry audit (Apr 2026): every scenario anchored to a
#        named locality with cited fluid values; locality_chemistry.json
#        is the data-source-of-truth.
#   v3 — supergene/arsenate expansion (Apr 2026): ferrimolybdite
#        (Pb-absent Mo-oxidation fork), arsenopyrite (Au-trapping primary
#        sulfide), and scorodite (arsenate supergene product with
#        pH-gated dissolution) engines added. Shifts Mo distribution
#        wherever O₂/Fe are available (porphyry, bisbee, supergene), and
#        shifts Au distribution in reducing-As scenarios (arsenopyrite
#        now traps a fraction of Au as invisible-gold trace before
#        native_gold can nucleate).
#   v4 — sulfate expansion round 5 (Apr 2026): seven sulfates added —
#        barite + celestine + jarosite + alunite + brochantite +
#        antlerite + anhydrite. Activated Coorong sabkha celestine +
#        anhydrite immediately; Bingham/Bisbee jarosite/alunite/anhydrite
#        post-event; Bisbee brochantite/antlerite supergene Cu sulfate
#        suite. Engine count 55 → 62. Two gaps documented at the time:
#        Tri-State + Sweetwater O2=0.0 blocked barite + celestine, and
#        Tsumeb pH=6.8 blocked scorodite + jarosite + alunite.
#   v5 — gap-fill follow-ups (Apr 2026): bumps Tri-State + Sweetwater
#        scenarios from O2=0.0 (default — strictly reducing) to O2=0.2
#        (mildly reducing, matching real MVT brine where SO₄²⁻ persists
#        alongside galena's H₂S — the chemistry that makes barite +
#        galena coexistence the diagnostic MVT assemblage). Activates
#        the dormant Ba=20/25 + Sr=15/12 pools in both scenarios.
#        Plus (Tsumeb commit, separate): adds early
#        ev_supergene_acidification event at step 5 + bumps Tsumeb Al
#        3→15, opening a 15-step acid window for scorodite + jarosite +
#        alunite to nucleate before ev_meteoric_flush at step 20
#        carbonate-buffers pH back up.
#   v8 — Round 8 mineral expansion (Apr 2026, COMPLETE): 15 new species
#        across 5 sub-rounds, engine count 69 → 84, tests 842 → 1037.
#        Three new mineral-mechanic patterns added to the sim plus
#        five new chemistry-dispatch patterns.
#
#        Silver suite (8a, 3 species):
#          • acanthite (Ag₂S, monoclinic) — first Ag mineral. Hits
#            seed-42 in mvt/reactive_wall/bisbee.
#          • argentite (Ag₂S, cubic) + 173°C PARAMORPH MECHANIC. First
#            non-destructive polymorph in the sim — argentite crystals
#            cooling past 173°C convert in-place to acanthite while
#            preserving habit + dominant_forms + zones. Module-level
#            PARAMORPH_TRANSITIONS dict + apply_paramorph_transitions
#            hook in run_step. Bisbee shows 5 argentite + 2 paramorphic
#            acanthite-after-argentite at seed-42; porphyry stays >173°C
#            with 8 pure argentite.
#          • native_silver (Ag) — S-DEPLETION GATE engine. Fires only
#            when S<2 AND O2<0.3 (inverse of normal supersaturation).
#            Habit variants include the Kongsberg 30-cm wire.
#
#        Native element trio (8b, 3 species):
#          • native_arsenic (As) — S+Fe overflow gates (S>10 → realgar/
#            arsenopyrite; Fe>50 → arsenopyrite).
#          • native_sulfur (S) — synproportionation Eh-window engine
#            (0.1<O2<0.7), the H₂S/SO₄²⁻ boundary chemistry. First Eh-
#            window engine; pH<5 + Fe+Cu+Pb+Zn<100 base-metal-poverty
#            gates.
#          • native_tellurium (Te) — Au+Ag overflow gates (Au>1 →
#            calaverite; Ag>5 → hessite). Au-Te coupling round now
#            unblocked.
#
#        Ni-Co sulfarsenide cascade (8c, 3 species + Bisbee scenario):
#          • nickeline (NiAs) — high-T Ni arsenide.
#          • millerite (NiS) — capillary brass-yellow needles. Mutual-
#            exclusion gate with nickeline (As>30 + T>200 → 0).
#          • cobaltite (CoAsS) — THREE-ELEMENT GATE engine, the first
#            in the sim (Co + As + S all required simultaneously).
#          • Bisbee scenario chemistry: Co=80 + Ni=70 added (citing
#            Graeme et al. 2019). Activates the supergene erythrite +
#            annabergite cascade at seed-42 (1 + 4 crystals in bisbee,
#            18 + 19 in supergene_oxidation).
#          • Erythrite + annabergite narrators refreshed to surface
#            cobaltite/nickeline/millerite as paragenetic parents.
#
#        VTA suite (8d, 5 species + Tsumeb W chemistry):
#          • descloizite (PbZnVO₄(OH)) + mottramite (PbCu(VO₄)(OH)) —
#            Cu/Zn-RATIO FORK dispatcher (Cu>Zn → mottramite, Zn≥Cu →
#            descloizite). The Tsumeb cherry-red / olive-green pair.
#          • raspite (PbWO₄, monoclinic) + stolzite (PbWO₄, tetragonal)
#            — KINETIC-PREFERENCE DISPATCHER (when both gates clear,
#            stolzite wins ~90% of rolls, reflecting natural ~10:1
#            occurrence ratio). First kinetic-preference engine.
#          • olivenite (Cu₂AsO₄(OH)) — Cu/Zn fork with adamite (the
#            existing Zn arsenate). Adamite engine retrofitted with
#            inverse Cu>Zn gate for symmetric dispatch.
#          • supergene_oxidation scenario: W=20 added (Strunz 1959 —
#            Tsumeb deep oxidation hosts minor scheelite + lead-
#            tungstate suite). Pb thresholds tuned 100→40 to match real
#            supergene fluid concentrations.
#          • Vanadinite + adamite narrators refreshed to surface the
#            descloizite/mottramite + olivenite companions.
#          • Seed-42 hits: bisbee olivenite=10, porphyry olivenite=3,
#            supergene_oxidation stolzite=9 (kinetic winner over
#            raspite) + adamite=1 + vanadinite=5.
#
#        Chalcanthite (8e, 1 species + water-solubility mechanic):
#          • chalcanthite (CuSO₄·5H₂O) — bright blue water-soluble
#            terminal Cu-sulfate phase.
#          • WATER-SOLUBILITY METASTABILITY MECHANIC: per-step hook in
#            run_step re-dissolves chalcanthite when fluid.salinity<4
#            OR fluid.pH>5. When growth<0.5µm, asymptotic decay
#            collapses to full dissolution. Distinct from THERMAL_
#            DECOMPOSITION (high-T destruction) and PARAMORPH_
#            TRANSITIONS (in-place mineral conversion). First re-
#            dissolvable mineral.
#
#        Engine count 69 → 84 (+15). Tests 842 → 1037 (+195).
#   v9 — Round 9 supergene-suite mineral expansion (Apr 2026), shipped
#        in sub-rounds:
#        • 9a: rosasite + aurichalcite + the **broth-ratio branching**
#          mechanic. First mineral pair where the *ratio* of fluid
#          elements (Cu vs Zn for the carbonate pair) — not presence/
#          absence — gates nucleation. Same parent broth, opposite
#          outcome.
#        • 9b: torbernite + zeunerite + the **anion-competition**
#          mechanic. The 3-branch generalization of 9a's 2-branch
#          ratio gate, with three uranyl minerals competing for the
#          same U⁶⁺ cation, differentiated by which anion (PO₄³⁻/
#          AsO₄³⁻/VO₄³⁻) dominates. 9b shipped the P + As branches.
#        • 9c: carnotite + completion of the anion-competition trio.
#          V-branch (canary-yellow Colorado Plateau crusts, K-cation
#          instead of Cu, monoclinic instead of tetragonal). Also
#          widens torbernite + zeunerite supersat denominators from
#          P+As to P+As+V so V-rich fluid properly routes to carnotite.
#          The mechanic now properly 3-way competitive.
#        Both mechanics establish patterns reusable for future
#        ratio-driven pairs/trios. Engine count 84 → 89 (+5 across
#        9a + 9b + 9c). No new FluidChemistry fields. First commits
#        to populate test_cases on data/minerals.json (per
#        proposals/TASK-BRIEF-DATA-AS-TRUTH.md item 6).
#   v10 — Twin bug fix (Apr 2026, Round 9 closeout patch). Pre-fix,
#        each grow_*() function rolled twinning probability per growth
#        step, so a crystal with 30 zones at p=0.1 had ~92% cumulative
#        twinning rate instead of the declared per-roll 10%. Post-fix,
#        the roll happens once at nucleation per declared twin_law in
#        data/minerals.json (VugSimulator._roll_spontaneous_twin).
#        Most existing minerals' realized twin rate drops dramatically —
#        from near-certainty over a typical crystal lifetime down to
#        the spec-declared per-roll probability (typically 1-10%).
#        Quartz Dauphiné (thermal_shock trigger) remains in grow_quartz
#        as event-conditional logic. Cuprite spinel-twin habit branch
#        was removed; spinel-twinned cuprite now carries the default
#        octahedral habit plus the twinned flag. Verified by
#        tools/twin_rate_check.py — all 25 spontaneously-twinned
#        minerals match declared probabilities within ±2σ binomial
#        tolerance at n=2000.

    Per Kim, Kimura, Putnis, Putnis, Lee, Sun (2023) Science 382:915-920
    (doi:10.1126/science.adi3690), dolomite growth requires CYCLIC
    dissolution-precipitation. Steady-state precipitation produces
    disordered Ca/Mg surface layers that prevent the ordered structure
    from forming. Brief undersaturation strips the disordered fraction
    preferentially (it's more soluble), leaving ordered atoms as a
    template. Each cycle ratchets ordering up; ~10²-10³ cycles in lab,
    less in the abstract sim timescale.

    Mechanism here: when σ_dolomite drops below 1 from above (transient
    undersaturation), emit a small "Kim-cycle etch" zone (-0.3 µm) that
    increments crystal.phantom_count via add_zone(). Growth-rate factor
    f_ord = 1 - exp(-phantom_count / 50) ramps from ~0% (no cycling) to
    ~95% (well-cycled). Steady-state high-σ runs grow disordered HMC;
    only event-driven scenarios (acid pulses, T cycles, mixing-zone
    oscillation) build true dolomite.

    Trend, Missouri.

    Anchor: Sweetwater Mine (Reynolds County, MO), part of the Viburnum
    Trend Pb-Zn district. Host = Cambrian Bonneterre Formation
    dolomitic limestone. Viburnum is a Ba-rich MVT endmember
    (Stoffell et al. 2008 distinguishes it from the lower-Ba, higher-Ag
    Tri-State district). Classic acid-into-carbonate paragenesis:
    sphalerite-galena-marcasite ± barite, dolomite-calcite gangue.
    Sverjensky 1981 (Econ. Geol. 76) and Leach et al. 2010 are the

    Mechanic: acid entering a carbonate vug doesn't just dissolve
    crystals — it dissolves the WALL. The wall neutralizes the acid
    AND releases Ca²⁺/CO₃²⁻ back into solution. When pH recovers,
    that dissolved carbonate supersaturates and precipitates as rapid
    growth bands on existing crystals. The acid is both destroyer and
    creator. The vug enlarges as the crystals grow. Repeated acid
    pulses model the Viburnum dissolution→supersaturation→growth
    burst cycle.

    """Minas Gerais Gem Pegmatite Pocket — anchored to the Cruzeiro mine,
    Doce Valley, Minas Gerais (Variant A).

    A miarolitic cavity in a complex zoned pegmatite at the São Francisco
    craton margin. Brasiliano orogeny, 700–450 Ma. The outer pegmatite
    shell (microcline + quartz + muscovite + schorl) has already
    crystallized; this vug is the residual pocket where incompatible
    elements (Be, B, Li, F) accumulate beyond belief before crossing
    saturation and nucleating their exotic species.

    Anchor: Cruzeiro mine (São José da Safira, Doce Valley, MG) — the
    type-locality for fine schorl-elbaite tourmaline + smoky quartz
    pockets, with documented beryl, spodumene, lepidolite, and
    accessory apatite. Brasiliano-age (Neoproterozoic) pegmatite field
    cutting Macaúbas Group meta-sediments. Morteani et al. 2002 covers
    fluid chemistry; Cassedanne (1991) and Proctor (1985) cover the
    Cruzeiro-specific paragenesis.

    Thermal regime: 650 → 300°C over ~220 steps in three phases.
    Phase 1 (650–550°C): wall-zone crystallization (microcline, quartz,
    early schorl).
    Phase 2 (550–400°C): main pocket growth. Beryl finally nucleates
    when Be crosses threshold; spodumene when Li crosses; schorl
    transitions to elbaite as Fe depletes and Li accumulates.
    Phase 3 (400–300°C): late hydrothermal — topaz if F survives,
    goethite if any Fe-sulfides weathered.

    Saturation cascade mechanic: there is no explicit "nucleate beryl
    now" command. Each mineral's supersaturation formula reads the
    current fluid, and the nucleation gates fire in order naturally
    as chemistry evolves — microcline first (K-feldspar = feldspar here),
    then the Be/Li/B gates cross as incompatible elements build up.

    """Bisbee, Arizona — Warren Mining District, Cochise County.

    The classic copper porphyry with a world-class oxidation zone. The
    complete Cu paragenesis from primary sulfides through supergene
    enrichment to the cyan-blue chrysocolla of the oxidation finale.

    Host rock: a combo — Laramide quartz-monzonite porphyry intruded
    into Paleozoic Escabrosa Limestone + Abrigo Formation. In the sim
    this is represented as a limestone wall (the pH buffer, the CO₃
    source for azurite) with scenario events that inject dissolved
    SiO₂ from the surrounding silicate matrix weathering — the supply
    path for late chrysocolla.

    Centerpiece mechanic: the azurite ↔ malachite ↔ chrysocolla
    cascade. Azurite dominates at high pCO₂ (event 4, CO₃ ≥ 120 ppm).
    A pCO₂-drop event (event 6) dissolves azurite and fires
    malachite. A silica-seep event (event 7) dissolves malachite-
    without-silica and fires chrysocolla pseudomorphs on the
    remaining azurite crystals. Three carbonate/silicate phases
    recording three different groundwater chemistries, each one
    freezing a different step of the Cochise County monsoon.

    ultramafic country rock, ruby forms; with Fe+Ti, blue sapphire;
    with Fe alone, yellow sapphire.
