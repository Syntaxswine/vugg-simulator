🪨 Vugg Simulator — A text-based crystal growth engine

Simulates mineral crystallization inside a vug (cavity) under
evolving hydrothermal conditions. Text output describes what grows,
how it grows, and why.

Usage:
  python3 vugg.py                          # default scenario
  python3 vugg.py --scenario cooling       # simple cooling scenario  
  python3 vugg.py --scenario pulse         # fluid pulse event
  python3 vugg.py --scenario mvt           # Mississippi Valley-type deposit
  python3 vugg.py --scenario reactive_wall # Acid pulses dissolve limestone walls
  python3 vugg.py --steps 200             # more time steps
  python3 vugg.py --interactive           # manual control mode

The engine is modular — minerals are plugins, events are injectable,
and the output format is extensible.

# SIM VERSION
# ============================================================
# Monotonic version tag bumped by any change that could shift seed-42
# output for any scenario (chemistry retune, engine change, new mineral,
# new event, new mechanic). Used by the scenario-chemistry audit and
# later by the multi-ring 3D simulation (see PROPOSAL-3D-SIMULATION.md)
# to distinguish v1 (pre-audit) from v2 (post-audit) output streams.
#
#   v1 — pre-audit: generic FluidChemistry defaults, Mg=0 in most scenarios
#   v2 — scenario-chemistry audit (Apr 2026): every scenario anchored to a
#        named locality with cited fluid values; locality_chemistry.json
#        is the data-source-of-truth.
#   v3 — supergene/arsenate expansion (Apr 2026): ferrimolybdite
#        (Pb-absent Mo-oxidation fork), arsenopyrite (Au-trapping primary
#        sulfide), and scorodite (arsenate supergene product with
#        pH-gated dissolution) engines added. Shifts Mo distribution
#        wherever O₂/Fe are available (porphyry, bisbee, supergene), and
#        shifts Au distribution in reducing-As scenarios (arsenopyrite
#        now traps a fraction of Au as invisible-gold trace before
#        native_gold can nucleate).
#   v4 — sulfate expansion round 5 (Apr 2026): seven sulfates added —
#        barite + celestine + jarosite + alunite + brochantite +
#        antlerite + anhydrite. Activated Coorong sabkha celestine +
#        anhydrite immediately; Bingham/Bisbee jarosite/alunite/anhydrite
#        post-event; Bisbee brochantite/antlerite supergene Cu sulfate
#        suite. Engine count 55 → 62. Two gaps documented at the time:
#        Tri-State + Sweetwater O2=0.0 blocked barite + celestine, and
#        Tsumeb pH=6.8 blocked scorodite + jarosite + alunite.
#   v5 — gap-fill follow-ups (Apr 2026): bumps Tri-State + Sweetwater
#        scenarios from O2=0.0 (default — strictly reducing) to O2=0.2
#        (mildly reducing, matching real MVT brine where SO₄²⁻ persists
#        alongside galena's H₂S — the chemistry that makes barite +
#        galena coexistence the diagnostic MVT assemblage). Activates
#        the dormant Ba=20/25 + Sr=15/12 pools in both scenarios.
#        Plus (Tsumeb commit, separate): adds early
#        ev_supergene_acidification event at step 5 + bumps Tsumeb Al
#        3→15, opening a 15-step acid window for scorodite + jarosite +
#        alunite to nucleate before ev_meteoric_flush at step 20
#        carbonate-buffers pH back up.

    depth-slice view. Each cell is a wedge of angular arc, with its own
    `wall_depth` — how much acid has pushed that chunk of wall outward.

    Dissolution is per-cell: cells covered by an acid-resistant crystal
    shield their wall slice, so dissolution pushes unblocked cells
    outward more aggressively (total acid budget conserved) and the
    wall ends up shaped like the deposit history rather than a perfect
    circle.

    Phase 1 adds a naturalistic void shape on top: a two-stage
    bubble-merge profile built deterministically from `primary_bubbles`
    + `secondary_bubbles` + `shape_seed` bakes a per-cell
    `base_radius_mm` at init. Stage 1 is the main cavity (few large
    bubbles); stage 2 is satellite alcoves dug from the cavity's outer
    surface. Crystal growth mechanics still read `mean_diameter_mm`
    (visual-only change for Phase 1).

        Eh window where gold can't deposit if Au activity is high.

        Sulfur suppression is the main competing factor: above
        ~100 ppm S, Au stays in Au-HS solution and/or partitions into

        Chryssoulis 1990). In the sim, grow_arsenopyrite consumes some
        fluid.Au and records it as trace_Au on the growth zone; when
        the crystal later oxidizes (supergene regime), the trapped Au
        is released back to fluid — the mechanism of supergene Au
        enrichment in orogenic oxidation zones (Graeme et al. 2019).

        Oxidation pathway: arsenopyrite + O₂ + H₂O →
          Fe³⁺ + AsO₄³⁻ + H₂SO₄. The released Fe + As feed scorodite
        nucleation; the H₂SO₄ drop in pH further keeps scorodite in
        its stability window (pH < 5).

    Per Kim, Kimura, Putnis, Putnis, Lee, Sun (2023) Science 382:915-920
    (doi:10.1126/science.adi3690), dolomite growth requires CYCLIC
    dissolution-precipitation. Steady-state precipitation produces
    disordered Ca/Mg surface layers that prevent the ordered structure
    from forming. Brief undersaturation strips the disordered fraction
    preferentially (it's more soluble), leaving ordered atoms as a
    template. Each cycle ratchets ordering up; ~10²-10³ cycles in lab,
    less in the abstract sim timescale.

    Mechanism here: when σ_dolomite drops below 1 from above (transient
    undersaturation), emit a small "Kim-cycle etch" zone (-0.3 µm) that
    increments crystal.phantom_count via add_zone(). Growth-rate factor
    f_ord = 1 - exp(-phantom_count / 50) ramps from ~0% (no cycling) to
    ~95% (well-cycled). Steady-state high-σ runs grow disordered HMC;
    only event-driven scenarios (acid pulses, T cycles, mixing-zone
    oscillation) build true dolomite.

    """Cooling scenario anchored at the Herkimer "diamond" pocket, Middleville, NY.

    Anchor: Herkimer-type double-terminated quartz crystals occur in isolated
    vugs of the Little Falls Formation, an Upper Cambrian dolostone in the
    Mohawk Valley. (Note: the audit brief drafted "Lockport Dolostone" — that
    is Silurian and hosts different mineralization; Herkimer's host is the
    Little Falls Formation, confirmed by Selleck 1978 and multiple state
    geological summaries.) The quartz itself crystallized much later,
    during Alleghenian burial diagenesis in the Carboniferous (~340-300 Ma),
    when the section reached >3 km depth and ~140-200°C. Silica was liberated
    by pressure solution and hydrocarbon cracking in adjacent shales, then
    precipitated free-floating crystals in silica-overpressured pockets
    that were also saturated with petroleum and saline basinal brine —
    hence the two-phase enhydro + anthraxolite inclusions diagnostic of
    Herkimer specimens.

    All fluid values cite locality_chemistry.json#localities.herkimer_middleville.
    The sim uses abstracted sim-scale ppm, not raw brine concentrations.

    Signature: clear, doubly-terminated quartz. Minimal carbonate competition
    (most Ca/CO3 has sequestered as dolomite cement in the host rock).

    Data gaps (see locality_chemistry.json): no widely-indexed modern
    microthermometry study publishes Th and Tm_ice specifically for
    Herkimer pocket quartz; the 140-200°C window is inferred from regional
    Alleghenian thermal maturity (Harris et al. 1978; Friedman & Sanders 1982).

    zoning. Fluid evolution from the Landtwing et al. 2010 (Econ. Geol.

    subequal Na/K/Fe/Cu, upper brine endmember ~45 wt% NaCl-eq
    coexisting with a low-density vapor (~0.2 g/cm³). Mo arrives in a
    distinct later pulse from Cu (Seo et al. 2012; already encoded in
    event_molybdenum_pulse).

    Chemistry-audit gap-fill pass (Apr 2026): added Na, K, Cl, Mg, Ag,
    Te to populate the brine-element baseline that was missing from
    the original scenario. Initial Cu and Mo remain at zero by design
    — they are delivered by event_copper_injection (step 25, 60) and
    event_molybdenum_pulse (step 45) respectively, modeling the
    discrete pulse pattern documented at Bingham.

    Trend, Missouri.

    Anchor: Sweetwater Mine (Reynolds County, MO), part of the Viburnum
    Trend Pb-Zn district. Host = Cambrian Bonneterre Formation
    dolomitic limestone. Viburnum is a Ba-rich MVT endmember
    (Stoffell et al. 2008 distinguishes it from the lower-Ba, higher-Ag
    Tri-State district). Classic acid-into-carbonate paragenesis:
    sphalerite-galena-marcasite ± barite, dolomite-calcite gangue.
    Sverjensky 1981 (Econ. Geol. 76) and Leach et al. 2010 are the

    Mechanic: acid entering a carbonate vug doesn't just dissolve
    crystals — it dissolves the WALL. The wall neutralizes the acid
    AND releases Ca²⁺/CO₃²⁻ back into solution. When pH recovers,
    that dissolved carbonate supersaturates and precipitates as rapid
    growth bands on existing crystals. The acid is both destroyer and
    creator. The vug enlarges as the crystals grow. Repeated acid
    pulses model the Viburnum dissolution→supersaturation→growth
    burst cycle.

    """Minas Gerais Gem Pegmatite Pocket — anchored to the Cruzeiro mine,
    Doce Valley, Minas Gerais (Variant A).

    A miarolitic cavity in a complex zoned pegmatite at the São Francisco
    craton margin. Brasiliano orogeny, 700–450 Ma. The outer pegmatite
    shell (microcline + quartz + muscovite + schorl) has already
    crystallized; this vug is the residual pocket where incompatible
    elements (Be, B, Li, F) accumulate beyond belief before crossing
    saturation and nucleating their exotic species.

    Anchor: Cruzeiro mine (São José da Safira, Doce Valley, MG) — the
    type-locality for fine schorl-elbaite tourmaline + smoky quartz
    pockets, with documented beryl, spodumene, lepidolite, and
    accessory apatite. Brasiliano-age (Neoproterozoic) pegmatite field
    cutting Macaúbas Group meta-sediments. Morteani et al. 2002 covers
    fluid chemistry; Cassedanne (1991) and Proctor (1985) cover the
    Cruzeiro-specific paragenesis.

    Thermal regime: 650 → 300°C over ~220 steps in three phases.
    Phase 1 (650–550°C): wall-zone crystallization (microcline, quartz,
    early schorl).
    Phase 2 (550–400°C): main pocket growth. Beryl finally nucleates
    when Be crosses threshold; spodumene when Li crosses; schorl
    transitions to elbaite as Fe depletes and Li accumulates.
    Phase 3 (400–300°C): late hydrothermal — topaz if F survives,
    goethite if any Fe-sulfides weathered.

    Saturation cascade mechanic: there is no explicit "nucleate beryl
    now" command. Each mineral's supersaturation formula reads the
    current fluid, and the nucleation gates fire in order naturally
    as chemistry evolves — microcline first (K-feldspar = feldspar here),
    then the Be/Li/B gates cross as incompatible elements build up.
