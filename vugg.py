🪨 Vugg Simulator — A text-based crystal growth engine

Simulates mineral crystallization inside a vug (cavity) under
evolving hydrothermal conditions. Text output describes what grows,
how it grows, and why.

Usage:
  python3 vugg.py                          # default scenario
  python3 vugg.py --scenario cooling       # simple cooling scenario  
  python3 vugg.py --scenario pulse         # fluid pulse event
  python3 vugg.py --scenario mvt           # Mississippi Valley-type deposit
  python3 vugg.py --scenario reactive_wall # Acid pulses dissolve limestone walls
  python3 vugg.py --steps 200             # more time steps
  python3 vugg.py --interactive           # manual control mode

The engine is modular — minerals are plugins, events are injectable,
and the output format is extensible.

        chrysocolla's σ collapses. Chrysocolla only wins when pCO₂
        has dropped and SiO₂ has risen (the Bisbee late-oxidation

    The classic copper porphyry with a world-class oxidation zone. The

    Host rock: a combo — Laramide quartz-monzonite porphyry intruded
    into Paleozoic Escabrosa Limestone + Abrigo Formation. In the sim
    this is represented as a limestone wall (the pH buffer, the CO₃
    source for azurite) with scenario events that inject dissolved
    SiO₂ from the surrounding silicate matrix weathering — the supply
    path for late chrysocolla.

    Centerpiece mechanic: the azurite ↔ malachite ↔ chrysocolla
    cascade. Azurite dominates at high pCO₂ (event 4, CO₃ ≥ 120 ppm).
    A pCO₂-drop event (event 6) dissolves azurite and fires
    malachite. A silica-seep event (event 7) dissolves malachite-
    without-silica and fires chrysocolla pseudomorphs on the
